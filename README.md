# How to develop
`graphql-js` package is cumbersome when using `yarn link` because it requires only one instance of the package and there are two.

To solve this problem you can deduplicate the instances by going into this project's `node_modules` and changing the file `node_modules/graphql/index.js` to

```js
module.exports = require('<path/to/the/tenant.store/node_modules/graphql/index.js>')
```
