Product group information. Product groups are catalog entities that may contain variants. They are equivalent to VTEX [Products](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-product--2zrB2gFCHyQokCKKE8kuAw#), whereas each variant is equivalent to a VTEX [SKU](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-an-sku--1K75s4RXAQyOuGUYKMM68u#). For example, you may have a **Shirt** product group with associated products such as **Blue shirt size L**, **Green shirt size XL** and so on.
