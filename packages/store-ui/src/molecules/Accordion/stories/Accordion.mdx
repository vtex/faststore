## Components

The `Accordion` uses the [Compound Component](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks) pattern, its components are:

- `Accordion`: the wrapper component.
- `AccordionItem`: the component that wraps an item of the `Accordion`, which is composed of an `AccordionButton` and an `AccordionPanel`.
- `AccordionButton`: the button used to interact with its related `AccordionItem`, opening or closing the `AccordionPanel`.
- `AccordionPanel`: the panel that contains the contents of the `AccordionItem`.

## Props

All accordion-related components support all attributes also supported by the `<div>` tag, except for the `AccordionButton`, which renders the `<button>` tag.

Besides those attributes, the following props are also supported:

### `Accordion`

<ArgsTable of={Accordion} />

### `AccordionItem`

<ArgsTable of={AccordionItem} />

### `AccordionButton`

<ArgsTable of={AccordionButton} />

### `AccordionPanel`

<ArgsTable of={AccordionPanel} />

## CSS Selectors

```css
[data-store-accordion] {}
[data-store-accordion-item] {}
[data-store-accordion-button] {}
[data-store-accordion-panel] {}
```

The `AccordionButton` component inherits [Button](?path=/docs/atoms-button--button#css-selectors) css selectors.
