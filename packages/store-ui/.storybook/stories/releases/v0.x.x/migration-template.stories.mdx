# v0.x.x Migration Guide

- [Button](#button)
  - [Props changes](#props-changes)
  - [Atoms refactored](#atoms-refactored)

For better performance and better DX (developer experience) in usage, we did major refactors for the following components:

## `Button`

From v0.x.x onwards, `Button` will be a simple atom.

### Props changes

| Props | Status     | Changes |
| ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| as    | Deprecated | N/A     |
| href  | Deprecated | N/A     |

**Before**

```js
// ...Code Example
```

**In v0.x.x**

```js
// ...Code Example
```

## Atoms refactored

As the better web performance is one of our main goals, we refactored components without additional logic into functional components:

- [Button](?path=/story/atoms-button--button)
- [Input](?path=/story/atoms-input--default)
