# Link

`Link` component performs the same behavior of a regular anchor tag (`<a>`), but can be used as any HTML tag.

## Default

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-link--default" />
</Canvas>

## As Div

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-link--as-div" />
</Canvas>

## Props

The component supports all attributes also supported by the choosen tag (through the prop `as`).

For example, in cases it is wanted to be used as a wrapper for any external link component (i.e., Next.js Link or Gatsby Link), the component can be used with the prop `as="div"`.

Besides those attributes, the following props are also supported:

<ArgsTable of={StorybookLink} />

## CSS Selectors

```css
[data-store-link] {
}
```
