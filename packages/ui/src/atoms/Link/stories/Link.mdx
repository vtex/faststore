# Link

`Link` component can be used both as a regular anchor tag and as a wrapper for any external Link component (i.e., Next.js Link or Gatsby Link).

## Link as Div

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-link--link-as-div" />
</Canvas>

## Link as Anchor

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-link--link-as-anchor" />
</Canvas>

## Props

The component supports all attributes also supported by the `<div>` tag (when working as a wrapper) and the `<a>` tag (when working as an anchor).

<ArgsTable of={Link} />

[data-store-link] {
}
```
