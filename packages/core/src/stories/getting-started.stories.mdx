## Sections

This product is designed and built following the **Atomic Design pattern**. Atomic Design breaks user interfaces hierarchically into smaller and simpler components. In this Storybook, we organized our components in the following groups:

- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organisms
- Features: group of components related to a specific feature, such as `Regionalization`.

---

## Subsections

Also, on the component's pages we use the following terms:

- `Compound Components`: list components that compound it.
- `Related Components`: list components that are related.
- `Use Cases/Examples`: list examples of where the components are applied.
- `Components`: list components that are part of a Feature.
