FastStore nextjs.store is an ecommerce-focused library that provides best-of-breed components, blazing-fast performance, and a frictionless development experience to create storefronts using [FastStore UI library](https://www.faststore.dev/reference/ui/faststore-ui) as base.

This product is designed and built following the **Atomic Design pattern**. Atomic Design breaks user interfaces hierarchically into smaller and simpler components. There are five distinct levels in Atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages), and that's how our components are classified.
