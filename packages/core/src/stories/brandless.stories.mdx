# Brandless

This themeable structure is made of two complementary layers: a useful and assorted library of templates for the components and sections, alongside a comprehensive set of design tokens to further customize them.

<ButtonLink
  variant="tertiary"
  href="../?path=/docs/theming-customizing--page"
  data-fs-button-size="small"
>
  Customizing your store
  <Icon name="ArrowRight" width="18" height="18" weight="bold" />
</ButtonLink>

</header>

**Structural Styles**, the first layer, has foundational styles that lay things out in common design patterns for different use cases. It also covers a component's fundamental interactions, like showing/hiding a dropdown or moving a toggle’s knob to make it active.

The second, **Theme**, is where the branding lives and what truly differentiates one UI from another. Graphic elements—like typography (and type scale), colors, imagery, borders, spacing, & more—are controlled by design tokens that a developer can easily tweak to create a unique look and feel.

  style={{ width: '70%', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>

Additional styles can be added to overwrite what was set in the Structure and/or Theme, reaching a state of total flexibility and freedom. Lastly, the developer can throw away all existing FastStore CSS altogether and build it from scratch.

## Theming architecture

Starting from the bottom up, we have the components: fully-featured UI blocks that belong to a larger whole system. The components have their own CSS that defines their overall appearance and how things are arranged; these scoped stylesheets are the Templates. The Templates' visual properties are tied to local variables—design tokens—that draw the final picture of the component; these local, scoped variables, on the other hand, are tied to global tokens, which form the Theme.

## Design tokens naming scheme

### Scoped Tokens (components)

All components' design tokens must follow a strict scheme to achieve predictability and cohesiveness. The tokens parts must tell:

- **Namespacing**: Where this token is coming from (is it a global or a component's local part);
- **Component**: Their semantic meaning;
- **Type**: What property type it affects;
- **Category** Which category of this type is going to be affected;
- **State**: Their interactive state.

If needed, we can use other additional incrementation to the token's name, such as:

- **Hierarchy**: Define its tier;
- **Nested Element**: To sytle elements contained inside the component;
- **Variant**: What differentiate it from the default;
- **Situation**: When they should be used;

### Theme (or global design tokens)

Global design tokens are parameters that affect all UI look 'n' feel. They are the main configuration file of a Theme. It's constituted of three main groups:

1. Branding Core
2. UI Essentials
3. Refinements
