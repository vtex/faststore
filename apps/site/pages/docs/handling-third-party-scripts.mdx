# Handling Third-Party Scripts

In this guide, you'll learn how to add a third-party script into FastStore projects.

Third-party scripts often refer to elements embedded in a webpage and served by a domain different from the one being accessed. These scripts can include social sharing buttons, video player embeds, ads, analytics, and other scripts that make the web more dynamic and interactive.

## Before you start

- To maintain your website's performance without sacrificing the functionality offered by third-party scripts, consider incorporating only those third-party scripts that truly enhance the value of your website.

- Ensure that you are using `@faststore/core` version 2.1.82 or above.

## Step by step

1. In the Starter project, inside the `src` folder, create a folder named `scripts`.
2. Within the `src/scripts` folder, create `ThirdPartyScripts.tsx` file.
3. In the `ThirdPartyScripts.tsx` file add your script as the example below:

```tsx filename="src/scripts/ThirdPartyScripts.tsx" {7} copy
const ThirdPartyScripts = () => {
  return (
    <script
      type="text/partytown"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        // Add your script here and remove the console.log example
        __html: "console.log('🚀 Hello from a third-party script!')",
      }}
    />
  )
}

export default ThirdPartyScripts
```

4. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser and open the Terminal tab. You should be able to see the message ("Hello from a third-party script"):
