# Adding third-party scripts

</header>

In this guide, learn how to add third-party scripts to FastStore projects.

Third-party scripts are elements embedded in a webpage but served from a different domain than the one the user visits. 
Examples of these scripts include social media buttons, video players, ads, analytics tools, and other elements contributing to a more dynamic and interactive web experience.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Choose essential third-party scripts
To maintain your website's performance without compromising the functionality offered 
by third-party scripts, consider incorporating only those third-party scripts that
enhance the value of your website.

### Update the `@faststore/core` version
Ensure your project uses `@faststore/core` version `2.1.82` or above. If not, follow these steps:
1. Open the FastStore code project.
2. Navigate to the `package.json` file.
3. Find the `@faststore/core` package and change its version to `2.1.82`. 
4. In your terminal, run `yarn install` to update the package in the project.

### Verify compatibility with Partytown

FastStore uses [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/) for script execution. Not all third-party scripts may be compatible with Partytown, so we strongly recommend testing third-party scripts with Partytown before implementing them. If any issues occur, avoid using those particular scripts. 

</Steps>

## Step by step

1. In your FastStore project, navigate to the `src` folder and create a folder named `scripts`.

2. Within the `src/scripts` folder, create the `ThirdPartyScripts.tsx` file.

3. In the `ThirdPartyScripts.tsx` file, add your script as the example below:

```tsx filename="src/scripts/ThirdPartyScripts.tsx" {7} copy
const ThirdPartyScripts = () => {
  return (
    <script
      type="text/partytown"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        // Add your script here and remove the console.log example
        __html: "console.log('ðŸš€ Hello from a third-party script!')",
      }}
    />
  )
}

export default ThirdPartyScripts
```

4. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server and execute the script you have added. 

5. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser, open the Developer Tools, and go to the `Console` tab. You should be able to see the message: `ðŸš€Hello from a third-party script!`:
