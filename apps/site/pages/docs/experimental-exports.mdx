# Experimental Exports - Hooks & Components

</header>

Utilize the helpful hooks and components provided by `@faststore/core` when customizing your application's components.

While some hooks are readily available through `@faststore/sdk`, others, like accessing cart and session data, are not accessible through this method.
Although users can manually implement some of these hooks, we believe in promoting simplicity, code reuse, and experimentation. To facilitate this, we've made these hooks available for direct import into your Starter project.

All exports are suffixed with `_unstable` to indicate that the support is experimental.
</Callout>

## Usage

You can import it into your component from `@faststore/core/experimental` as the following example:

```tsx copy
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'
import { useCartToggleButton_unstable as useCartToggleButton } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

export default function CustomBuyButton() {
  const { onClick: toggleCart } = useCartToggleButton()
  return (
    <UIButton
      variant="primary"
      onClick={() => {
        toggleCart()
      }}
    >
      New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

### Components

- Image_unstable

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We highly recommend using the Image component when working with images in your
  application to enhance the storefront performance. This component leverages an
  image resizing and cropping service, called Thumbor, which caches the results
  on CDN. (Use it when the image is uploaded in the VTEX admin, whether in the
  CMS or Catalog.)
</Callout>

```tsx {2} copy
import { HeroImage as UIHeroImage } from '@faststore/ui'
import { Image_unstable as Image } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

export default function CustomHeroImage() {
  return (
    <UIHeroImage>
      <Image
        src="https://storeframework.vtexassets.com/arquivos/ids/160965/est.jpg?v=637752924295370000"
        alt="Two puffs and two small desks placed together, accompanied by various color pencils."
        width={360}
        height={240}
        sizes="(max-width: 360px) 50vw, (max-width: 768px) 90vw, 50vw"
      />
    </UIHeroImage>
  )
}
```
