# Multiple page templates

</header>

Multiple page templates allow you to create flexible layouts in the Headless CMS for product and product listing pages (PDPs and PLPs) based on criteria like product information, user context, product type, brand, and template hierarchy. This means you can design and manage pages hierarchically instead of creating a single, static template for all products or listings.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This feature is already included in stores with the 3.x. `@faststore/core` package version. To update the `@faststore/core` package, refer to this [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
</Callout>
## Usage

To add these templates to your store, access the VTEX Admin and do the following:
1. Navigate to **Storefront > Headless CMS** and choose your FastStore project.
2. Click  `Create document` and choose between `Product Page` and `Product List Page`.

Now that you have one of the templates, understand how to use and edit in the next sections.

Even though the Multipage templates is a FastStore feature, you can benefit from the tutorial on [Managing pages in the Headless CMS](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/managing-pages--3DO6rBhZ1p3zndnFu5BgRt) to edit the template name, publish, duplicate, or delete it.
## PDP Template

When rendering the PDPs, FastStore will use the product information to find the appropriate document from the CMS (template) to render, starting from the most specific template (slug) of the product to the most generic (`department` or the generic PDP).

The order should be as follows:

1.  A PDP document that matches the product slug;
2.  A PDP document that matches the product `subcategory`;
3.  A PDP document that matches the product `category`;
4.  A PDP document that matches the product `department` (collection);
5.  If no matches are found, use the generic PDP template.

Let's see the examples below:

While using PDPs, note that this type of page is recognized by the slug pattern [https://starter.vtex.app/apple-magic-mouse/p](https://starter.vtex.app/apple-magic-mouse/p)

You can create the template based on the slug `/apple-magic-mouse/p`.

![PDP Slug template](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/pdpslug___95ada5a5b24e23e34c04f4837d11ade7.png)

This is the most specific template, when the slug template exists, it will be rendered.
But there are cases where you would like to render a specific template for products inside a `subcategory` or a `department`, for instance, instead of using the slug.
Because of that, the template can assume different behaviors based on the input value beyond the slug: `subcategory`, `category`, `department`, or the generic template.

The products in VTEX catalog are under a `category` tree, usually `/department/category/subcategory/`.
Note that the product mentioned above is in the Technology `department` from the catalog. Then, you can create a `department` template.

![PDP Department template](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/pdpdepartment___387cf641f675d05666afeafc65a3e56b.png)

If this product were under a `subcategory`, would also be possible to create a template representing this scenario. The category tree is used in the template input, separated by slashes.

![PDP subcategory template](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/pdpsubcategory___566be1fd3bba2db777dd18881933292c.png)

You can also see the category hierarchy through the breadcrumb.

If there are no matches for slug or `department`, the generic template will be used to render this PDP. So you need to create a document with an empty value in the template input field.

Possible templates in CMS from this product:

- Slug: `/apple-magic-mouse/p`
- Department: `/technology/`
- PDP generic template: (empty value)

### PLP Template

The PLP multiple-page template approach follows a similar logic to the PDP, but for PLPs FastStore will use only the slug information to find the appropriate document (template) to render. The order should be as follows:

1.  A PLP document that matches the slug;
    1. A PLP document that matches the `subcategory` slug;
    2. A PLP document that matches the `category` slug;
    3. A PLP document that matches the `department` (collection) slug;
2.  If no matches are found, use the generic PLP template.

Let's see the examples below:
While using PLPs, note that this type of page is recognized by the slug pattern [https://starter.vtex.app/office/chairs](https://starter.vtex.app/office/chairs).

You can create the template based on the slug: `/office/chairs`

![PLP document list](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/plplist___854bd00fbbcc43d8ae25169917e85632.png)

Note that the slug above represents the `department` and `category` separated by slashes (department/category).

The products in VTEX catalog are under a category tree, usually `/department/category/subcategory`.
When the slug template exists, it will be rendered.

There are cases where you would like to render a specific template for products inside the `department` without considering the `category` or even a `subcategory`. For this case, you can create a `department` template [/office](https://starter.vtex.app/office/chairs).

![PLP department template](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/plpdepartment___4c520237721ca14a722215a93e8cd4c7.png)

Bear in mind that if another most specific template exists, like `/office/chairs`, the most specific will be rendered if the slug matches the same pattern.

If this product were under a `subcategory`, would also be possible to create a template representing this scenario. The category tree is used in the template slug input, like in the image below.

![PLP subcategory template](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/plpsubcategory___ac973acd0b5d1745e848f1a0a94c5988.png)

If there are no matches for the slug or department, the generic template will be used to render this PLP. So you need to create a document with an empty value in the template input field.

![PLP general template](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/plpgeneral___d5ecb7ef0a45bb0bfa6280ec719d9b80.png)

Possible templates in CMS from this product:

- Slug: `/office/chairs`
- Slug: `/office`
- PLP generic.
