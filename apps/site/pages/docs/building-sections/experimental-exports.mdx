# Experimental Exports - Hooks & Components

</header>

When overriding a native component or creating a new FastStore section, you can import the hooks and components from [`@faststore/core`](/docs#faststore-core-faststorecore) to customize specific functionalities without starting from scratch.
Although some hooks are accessible through `@faststore/sdk`, certain functionalities, such as accessing cart and session data, require the use of hooks and components from `@faststore/core`.

  All exports are suffixed with `_unstable` to indicate that the support is

## Usage

Import the hook or component into your component from `@faststore/core/experimental`:

```tsx copy
import { use{ComponentName}_unstable as use{ComponentName} } from '@faststore/core/experimental'
```

In the following example, the `useCartToggleButton_unstable` hook was imported to enhance the custom buy button
with the ability to toggle the cart, and benefeting from the behavior of the useCartToggleButton.

```tsx {3} copy
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'
import { useCartToggleButton_unstable as useCartToggleButton } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

export default function CustomBuyButton() {
  const { onClick: toggleCart } = useCartToggleButton()
  return (
    <UIButton
      variant="primary"
      onClick={() => {
        toggleCart()
      }}
    >
      New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

### Components

- [Image_unstable](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/blob/105a8b2f69ffd8438532d7c9eb959ed26a567675/packages/core/src/components/ui/Image/Image.tsx)

We highly recommend using the Image component when working with images in your application to enhance storefront performance. This component utilizes a service called [Thumbor](https://www.thumbor.org/) for image resizing and cropping, with the results cached on a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Utilize it whenever an image is uploaded in the VTEX admin, whether in the CMS or Catalog.

```tsx {2} copy
import { HeroImage as UIHeroImage } from '@faststore/ui'
import { Image_unstable as Image } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

export default function CustomHeroImage() {
  return (
    <UIHeroImage>
      <Image
        src="https://storeframework.vtexassets.com/arquivos/ids/160965/est.jpg?v=637752924295370000"
        alt="Two puffs and two small desks placed together, accompanied by various color pencils."
        width={360}
        height={240}
        sizes="(max-width: 360px) 50vw, (max-width: 768px) 90vw, 50vw"
      />
    </UIHeroImage>
  )
}
```
