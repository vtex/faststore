# Creating a new section

</header>

  This documentation is currently under development.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a new section for your store and making it available in the Headless CMS. This solution is useful when your store requires a section that is not available natively in FastStore.

For this guide we'll create a `Call to Action` section.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Sections are page components that wrap up other components to create a
  section. For example, the Hero section is a native section that includes the
  following components: `Hero (UIHero)`, `HeroImage (UIHeroImage)`, and
  `HeroHeader (UIHeroHeader)`.

## Before you start

**1. Integrate the store with the Headless CMS**

All sections must be available in the Headless CMS so they can be added and managed on your store's pages. To integrate your FastStore project, please refer to the [VTEX Headless CMS integration track](/tbd).

**2. Knowledge on how sections and content types work on Headless CMS**

During the creation of a new section, you will create files such as `sections.json` and `content-types.json`, which follow a structure established for the Headless CMS. For more information about these files, refer to
[Adding Content Types and Sections to the VTEX Headless CMS](/tbd)

## Step by step

### Step 1: Creating folders and files related to the Headless CMS

1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `faststore` folder, create the following files: `content-types.json` and `sections.json`.
4. In `sections.json` add the new section that you want to display in the Headless. The schema below defines how the Headless CMS renders a section:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "CallToAction",
    "schema": {
      "title": "Call To Action",
      "description": "Get your 20% off on the first purchase!",
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["title", "link"],
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Title"
        },
        "Link": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Link path"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

This new section receives a title and a link that can points to some place in the store.

### Step 2: Creating the new section

To render the `CallToAction` section that you created in the previous step, you need to create the section.

1. If you don't already have it, create a folder named `components` inside the src directory.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CallToAction.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react'

export default function CallToAction(props: any) {
  return (
    <h1 className="big-call-to-action">
      <a href={props.link}>{props.title}</a>
    </h1>
  )
}
```

This section will receive the `link` and `title` defined in the sections.json file.

3. Create a file named `index.tsx` inside the components folder.

<Callout type="info" emoji=" ℹ️ ">
  The `index.tsx` file provides an entry point for importing and using the
  `CallToAction` component. It acts as a container for all the components within
  the components folder and allows for easier organization and reusability of
  code.
</Callout>

Open the index.tsx file and add the following code:

```tsx
import CallToAction from './CallToAction'

export default { CallToAction }
```

### Step 3: Synchronizing the new section with the Headless CMS

1. In the terminal, run `yarn cms-sync`. This command will synchronize the new section you created with the @faststore/core.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Click on the `Home` content type.
4. In the `Sections` tab, click the `+`, search for the new `Call to Action` section, and add it to your page.
