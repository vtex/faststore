# Creating a New Section

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This documentation is currently under development.
</Callout>

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a new section for your store and make it available in the [Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-overview). This solution is useful when your store requires a section not natively available in FastStore.

For this guide we'll create a `Call to Action` section.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Sections are page components that wrap up other components, enabling you to create cohesive and functional content for your store. For example, the Hero section is a native section that includes the
  following components: `Hero`, `HeroImage`, and `HeroHeader`.
</Callout>

## Before you start

<Steps>
### 1. Integrate the store with the Headless CMS

All sections must be available in the Headless CMS so they can be added and managed on your store's pages. To integrate your FastStore project, please refer to the [Headless CMS integration track](/docs/headless-cms-integration/1-configuring-the-vtex-account).

### 2. Knowledge on how sections and content types work on Headless CMS

During the creation of a new section, you will create files such as `sections.json` and `content-types.json`, which follow a structure established for the Headless CMS.

### 3. Install the FastStore CLI

Make sure to install the FastStore CLI to use its commands locally. Refer to the [FastStore CLI](/docs/getting-started/4-faststore-cli#installing-faststore-cli-globally-using-npm) guide for more information.
</Steps>




## Step by step

### Step 1: Creating folders and files related to the Headless CMS

1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create `sections.json` file.
4. In the `sections.json` file add the new section that you want to display in the Headless CMS. The schema below defines how the Headless CMS renders a section:

```json filename="sections.json" copy
  {
    "name": "CallToAction",
    "schema": {
      "title": "Call To Action",
      "description": "Get your 20% off on the first purchase!",
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "title",
        "link"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "title": "Title",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "link": {
          "title": "Link Path",
          "type": "object",
          "required": [
            "text",
            "url"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "text": {
              "title": "Text",
              "type": "string"
            },
            "url": {
              "title": "URL",
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This new section receives a title and a link pointing to a specific location.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Creating the new section

To render the `CallToAction` section you created in the previous step, you need to create this section component.

1. If you don't already have it, create a folder named `components` inside the `src` directory.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CallToAction.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx filename="src/components/CallToAction.tsx" copy
import React from "react";

export interface CallToActionProps {
  title: string;
  link: {
    text: string;
    url: string;
  };
}

export default function CallToAction(props: CallToActionProps) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <a href={props.link.url}>{props.link.text}</a>
    </section>
  );
}
```

This section will receive the `link` and `title` defined previously in the `sections.json` file.

3. Create a file named `index.tsx` inside the components folder.

<Callout type="info" emoji=" ℹ️ ">
  The `index.tsx` file provides an entry point for importing and using the
  `CallToAction` component. It acts as a container for all the components within
  the components folder and allows for easier organization and reusability of
  code.
</Callout>

Open the `index.tsx` file and add the following code:

```tsx filename="src/components/index.tsx" copy
import CallToAction from './CallToAction'

export default { CallToAction }
```

### Step 3: Synchronizing the new section with the Headless CMS

1. In the terminal, run `faststore cms-sync`. This command will synchronize the new section you created with the CMS.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Click on the `Page` content type.

4. In the `Sections` tab, click the `+`, search for the new `Call to Action` section, and add it to your page.
