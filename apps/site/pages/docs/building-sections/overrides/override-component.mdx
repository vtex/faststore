# Overriding a native component
</header>

Now that you know how to [override a component's prop](LINK), learn how to override a native component to use a custom component.

For example, you may want to replace the current `BuyButton` component from the `ProductDetails` section to meet your business needs.

Currently, when the [`BuyButton`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules-buy-button) is clicked, it opens the `CartSideBar` as its default behavior:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-cart___a5853a88238fa31610a93e8a1333bb00.gif)

For this guide we will create a custom Buy Button that once you click on it, it displays an `alert` for the customer.

> ⚠️ Using overrides does not significantly impact performance. FastStore's handling of props and design tokens is designed for good performance. However, your customizations may introduce additional work, so consider overall store performance by checking Lighthouse reports on GitHub logs and Pull Requests.

## Before you begin

Make sure your `@faststore/core` package has the 3.x version or above. If you need to update
it, refer to this [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

--- 

## Step by step
### Step 1 - Setting up the component file

1. After choosing a native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections), open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder, and inside it, create the `sections` folder. You can run the following command to create them:

> ℹ️ The naming of the `sections` folder is arbitrary, as overrides can be created in any file, since the import is made in the `src/components/index.tsx` file. 

<Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>```bash copy mkdir src/components src/components/sections ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```bash copy mkdir src\components src\components\sections ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

3. In the `sections` folder, create a new file for your customized section. For example, create a new file named `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` under the `src/components/sections` directory.

4. Open the `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` file and update it with the following code:

```tsx filename="ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx" {8-9}
import { ProductDetailsSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'

const ProductDetailsWithCustomButton = getOverriddenSection({
  Section: ProductDetailsSection,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { Component: CustomBuyButton },
  },
})

export default ProductDetailsWithCustomButton;
```

#### Step 2 - Overriding the component

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components of each native section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections). 
In this example, we are overriding the `BuyButton` component in the `ProductDetails` section.

2. In the `components` folder, if you don't have already the `index.tsx` file, create the file and add the following:

```tsx filename="components/index.tsx" copy
import ProductDetailsWithCustomButton from "./sections/ProductDetailsWithCustomButton";

export default { ProductDetailsWithCustomButton };

```

### Step 3 - Adding the component to the CMS

To integrate the section into the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview), follow the steps below:

1. Create a folder named `cms` in the FastStore root directory.

2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.

3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create the `sections.json` file.

4. Add the schema of the new section to the `sections.json` file, named `CustomBuyButton`, to the `sections.json` file:

```json filename="sections.json" copy
  [
    {
        "name": "ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx",
        "requiredScopes": ["pdp"],
        "schema": {

          }
        }
      }
  ]
```

This schema Adds the new `Custom Buy Button` section to the Headless CMS.

5. Open a new terminal window and log in to your vtex account by running `vtex login {accountName}`.

6. run the following command to sync your changes with the Headless CMS:

```bash
yarn cms-sync
```
7. Access the VTEX Admin and proceed to **Storefront > Headless CMS**.

8. Click on the page you desire to add the new section.

9. Click the add button (`+`) and add the new section and complete values from the sections fields.

10. Click `Save`.

> ⚠️ Remember: props changed via Headless CMS overlap the changes made through [overrides](LINK).
  For example, if you change a prop through override and also change it using
  Headless CMS, the final prop's value will be the one added using CMS.

### Step 4 - Visualizing the component on the page locally

To see your changes locally you need to set the Headless CMS preview to the development mode. 
Refer to the [How to preview Headless CMS changes in development mode](/docs/how-to-preview-headless-cms-changes-in-development-mode) guide for more information.

Once you have set the preview for development mode, you should see your new Buy Button in a Product Details Page (PDP).

### Step 5 - Publishing your changes

If your changes are working in the development mode and you want to publish them, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the Headless CMS in the VTEX Admin.
2. Click on a PDP page.
3. Click `Publish` to make the new button available on the production store.
