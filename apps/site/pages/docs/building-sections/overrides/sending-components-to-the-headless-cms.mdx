# Syncing components with the Headless CMS

During the override of [components](/) and [props](/) one of the steps
is to make the overrided component available in the [Headless CMS]().

1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create the `sections.json` file.
4. Add the schema of the new section to the `sections.json` file. The schema defines how the Headless CMS renders the section.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  To structure the schema correctly refer to the [Step 3: Adding sections to the Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-integration/3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-3-adding-sections-to-the-headless-cms). 
  Also, refer to the [List of Native Sections and Overridable Components](/docs/building-sections/overrides/list-of-native-sections) to check the schemas for each component.

5. Open the terminal and log in to your vtex account by running `vtex login {accountName}`.

6. run the following command to sync your changes with the Headless CMS:

```bash
yarn cms-sync
```
7. Access the VTEX Admin and proceed to **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
8. Click on the page you desire to add the new section.
9. Click the add button (`+`) and add the new section.
10. Fill with the necessary values from the sections field.

## Previewing changes in the development mode

To see your changes locally you need to set the Headless CMS preview to the development mode. 
Refer to the [How to preview Headless CMS changes in development mode](/docs/how-to-preview-headless-cms-changes-in-development-mode) guide for more information.
