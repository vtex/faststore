# Add other icons option to the Alert component

This guide illustrates a common use case for [`getOverriddenSection`](/docs/building-sections/overrides/specification) in FastStore, focusing on customizing the Headless CMS schema for a section to provide more options.

## Context

- You want to create a dropdown in the Headless CMS allowing editors to choose from a wider selection of icons supported by the `@faststore/ui` library.
- The native Alert section provides a limited set of icon options.

## Implementation

By leveraging `getOverriddenSection`, you can customize the Alert section's Healess CMS schema to offer additional icon options.

1. Import the necessary component:

   ```tsx
   import { getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
   ```

2. Define the `CustomIconsAlert` component:

   ```tsx
/**
 * This is an alert override with custom icon options in the Headless CMS.
 *
 * Changes only the schema to include more options for native Icons supported by @faststore/ui.
 */

import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";

const CustomIconsAlert = getOverriddenSection({
  Section: AlertSection,
});

export default CustomIconsAlert;

   ```

   - This component is defined using `getOverriddenSection`.
   - The override options specify:
       - **`Section`:** The section to be overridden (Alert).
       - Since no further modifications are needed for this basic customization, the options object is empty.

3. Add the section to the Headless CMS by following the instructions available in [Sending components to the Headless CMS](/docs/building-sections/overrides/sending-components-to-the-headless-cms).
For the schema it was used the following:

```json

{
      "name": "CustomIconsAlert",
      "schema": {
        "title": "Alert with more Icon options",
        "description": "Add an alert that has more Icon options",
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["icon", "content", "dismissible"],
        "properties": {
          "icon": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Icon",
            "enumNames": [
              "Bell",
              "BellRinging",
              "Checked",
              "Info",
              "Truck",
              "User",
              "Plus",
              "PlusCircle",
              "Ruler",
              "Star",
              "Storefront",
              "Twitter"
            ],
            "enum": [
              "Bell",
              "BellRinging",
              "Checked",
              "Info",
              "Truck",
              "User",
              "Plus",
              "PlusCircle",
              "Ruler",
              "Star",
              "Storefront",
              "Twitter"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }

```
