# Add other icons option to the Alert component

This guide illustrates a common use case for [`getOverriddenSection`](/docs/building-sections/overrides/specification) in FastStore, focusing on customizing the Headless CMS schema for a section to provide more options.

> ℹ️ For detailed instructions on overriding components, refer to [overriding component props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-component-props) and [overriding a component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component).

## Context

- You want to create a dropdown in the Headless CMS allowing editors to choose from a wider selection of icons supported by the `@faststore/ui` library.
- The native Alert section provides a limited set of icon options.

## Implementation

By leveraging `getOverriddenSection`, you can customize the Alert section's Healess CMS schema to offer additional icon options.

1. Import the necessary component:

```tsx
import { getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'
```

2. Define the `CustomIconsAlert` component:

```tsx
/**
 * This is an alert override with custom icon options in the Headless CMS.
 *
 * Changes only the schema to include more options for native Icons supported by @faststore/ui.
 */

import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'

const CustomIconsAlert = getOverriddenSection({
  Section: AlertSection,
})

export default CustomIconsAlert
```

- This component is defined using `getOverriddenSection`.
- The override options specify:
  - **`Section`:** The section to be overridden (Alert).
  - Since no further modifications are needed for this basic customization, the options object is empty.

3. Add the section to the Headless CMS by following the instructions available in [Sending components to the Headless CMS](/docs/building-sections/overrides/sending-components-to-the-headless-cms).
   For the schema it was used the following:

```json
{
  "name": "CustomIconsAlert",
  "schema": {
    "title": "Alert with more Icon options",
    "description": "Add an alert that has more Icon options",
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["icon", "content", "dismissible"],
    "properties": {
      "icon": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Icon",
        "enumNames": [
          "Bell",
          "BellRinging",
          "Checked",
          "Info",
          "Truck",
          "User",
          "Plus",
          "PlusCircle",
          "Ruler",
          "Star",
          "Storefront",
          "Twitter"
        ],
        "enum": [
          "Bell",
          "BellRinging",
          "Checked",
          "Info",
          "Truck",
          "User",
          "Plus",
          "PlusCircle",
          "Ruler",
          "Star",
          "Storefront",
          "Twitter"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
