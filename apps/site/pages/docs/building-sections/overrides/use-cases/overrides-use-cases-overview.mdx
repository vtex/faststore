# Overrides use cases
</header>

The Overrides Use Cases show how we implemented section overrides, explaning the context, 
how we implemented, and what happened as a result. These examples can help you understand and go beyond with this feature.

| Use case | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Add other icons option to the Alert component](/docs/building-sections/overrides/use-cases/add-icons-to-the-alert-component) | Create a dropdown in the Headless CMS allowing editors to choose from a wider selection of icons supported by the `@faststore/ui` library.    |
| [Add an image to your Alert component](/docs/building-sections/overrides/use-cases/add-an-image-to-your-alert-component) | Make alert messages more engaging by allowing images alongside text content. |
