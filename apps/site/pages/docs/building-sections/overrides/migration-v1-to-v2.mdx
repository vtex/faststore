# Migrating Overrides v1 to v2
</header>

Section overrides v2 allow you to customize the appearance and functionality of existing components in your store. Overrides v2 offers a more powerful and adaptable approach compared to v1. We strongly recommend updating your customization methods to take advantage of these benefits.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you choose to continue using Overrides v1, please refer to the [Overriding components (v1)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props).

## Main differences

| Feature                       | Overrides v1                                           | Overrides v2                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overrides per section         | One override per section.                              | Multiple overrides per section.                                       |
| Importing Section             | String passed to `section` key.                        | Section component imported and passed to `Section` key (uppercase S). |
| Native section                | The new component overrides the native one.            | The new component is based on the native one and can coexist with it. |
| Headless CMS property schema  | No customization, limited to native schemas.           | Customizable schema allowing definition of new properties.            |
| Feature availability          | Experimental feature and may not function as expected. | Stable feature.                                                       |


## Step by step

<Steps>

### Update `@faststore/core` Package

Ensure your store's `@faststore/core` package is version 3.x or higher to utilize Overrides v2. Refer to the [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for updating instructions.

### Review existing overrides

Identify all overrides currently implemented using Overrides v1 (refer to the [Overrides v1](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props) documentation).

- **Keeping v1 overrides:** If you want to keep existing v1 overrides alongside new v2 overrides, avoid modifying the v1-overridden components. Create new overrides using v2 following the guide on [Overriding a component](LINK).

### Migrate Overrides (Optional Code Example)

Previously in Overrides v1, you passed the section name as a string to the `section` key within the `getOverriddenSection` method's overrides object. 
Here's an example:

```
const NewAlert = getOverriddenSection({  
  section: 'Alert',  
  components: {  
     Alert: { Component: CustomAlert },  
  },  
});  

export default NewAlert;  
```

Overrides v2 introduces a clearer syntax. Now you import the section component itself (e.g., `AlertSection` from `@faststore/core`) and pass it to the `Section` key (uppercase `S`) within the overrides object. This emphasizes the component-based approach of v2.

```
import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";  

const NewAlert = getOverriddenSection({ 
  Section: AlertSection, 
  components: {  
    Alert: { Component: CustomAlert },  
  }, 
});  

export default NewAlert;  
```

</Steps>
