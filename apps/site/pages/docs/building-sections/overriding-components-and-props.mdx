In this guide, you will learn about:

- [1. Override native component's props](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#1-override-native-component-by-overriding-its-props): Modify the behavior of a specific component by passing additional props to it in your store code.
- [2. Override a native component](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#2-overriding-a-native-component): Create a new component and override its native equivalent to achieve the desired functionality.

Before you begin, make sure you have a functioning FastStore project.

Also, consider the following:

- **This feature is experimental**: The feature may not function as expected.

- **Some sections contain multiple instances of the same component**: When overriding a component or passing additional props to it, consider that all instances will be affected by this change.

## Before you start

**Choose a native section and the component you want to customize.**

The `@faststore/core` package provides a set of native sections. These native sections are made up of various components, each offering distinct functionalities. You can customize specific components within a native section or replace them entirely with alternative options that better align with your desired functionality or appearance.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Setting up the `overrides` folder

1. Choose the native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-available-native-sections).
2. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
3. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder and inside it, create the `overrides` folder.

```bash
mkdir src/components src/components/overrides
```

4. Inside the `overrides` folder, create a new file named after the chosen native section. For example, if you chose the `ProductDetails` section for customization, create a new file named `ProductDetails.tsx` under the `src/components/overrides` directory.

```bash
touch src/components/overrides/ProductDetails.tsx
```

5. Copy and paste the following code snippet into the file:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = { section: SECTION, components: {} }

export { override }
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Change the value of the `SECTION` variable to the name of the section you want
  to override. In the given example, we set the `SECTION` variable to
  `ProductDetails` to override this specific section.
</Callout>

6. Save your changes.

## 1. Override native component by overriding its props

Overriding props allows you to customize a component's behavior without modifying the integration built for the native component.
This approach is particularly useful when you want to change specific aspects of a native component while preserving its integration.

All component customizations in FastStore are done within a section, so choose the native section and component you wish to override its props.
You can check the available native sections and its overridable components in the [List of available native sections](/tbd).
After knowing which components can be overridable, you can find the list of props for this component in our documentation.

For this guide, we'll use the `BuyButton` component and you can find the list of this component's props on the [BuyButton component documentation](/components/molecules/buy-button#props).

Here's how the initial component looks like with the `size` prop set as `regular` in the PDP (Product Details Page):

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-initial](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-pdp-buy-button-initial___a4b7ae9d88ed888da5649b2b6cc1eecd.png)

### Step by step

1. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file created in the [previoulsy step](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder) and add the following code:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { props: { size: 'small', iconPosition: 'right' } },
  },
}

export { override }
```

This code will override the `BuyButton` props `size` and `iconPosition`. You'll see a smaller button than the initial one, and the cart icon will be on the right.

2. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser and go to product details page to see the updated `BuyButton` component:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-props](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-pdp-buy-button-props___898b016bd82c908b5b24c8822be6789a.png)

## 2. Overriding a native component

Now that you know how to override a component's prop, you will learn how to override a native component to use a custom component.

For example, you may want to modify the behavior of the `BuyButton` component from the `ProductDetails` section to meet your business needs.

The current behavior of `BuyButton` when clicked is to open the `CartSideBar`:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-cart___a5853a88238fa31610a93e8a1333bb00.gif)

### Step by step

#### Step 1 - Create your custom component

1. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CustomBuyButton.tsx`. (If you haven't created the `components` folder yet, see the [previous step](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder))

```bash
touch src/components/CustomBuyButton.tsx
```

2. Copy and paste the following code into `CustomBuyButton.tsx` file:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'

export function CustomBuyButton() {
  return (
    <UIButton
      variant="primary"
      onClick={() => {
        alert('Hello User!')
      }}
    >
      New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

The code above imports the Button component from the [@faststore/ui](/components) package, and creates a `CustomBuyButton` component that, when clicked opens an alert. You can create any component as you wish.

#### Step 2 - Overriding the component

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components for each native section](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-native-sections). In this example, we are overriding the `BuyButton` component in the `ProductDetails` section.
2. Navigate to `src/components/overrides` that we've created [before](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder).
3. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file and update it with the following code:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'
import { CustomBuyButton } from '../CustomBuyButton'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { Component: CustomBuyButton },
  },
}

export { override }
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **By overriding a component, you lose all the integration developed on
  [@faststore/core](docs/getting-started/project-structure#faststorecore) for
  that component.** We highly recommend trying first [overriding
  props](/docs/component-customization/overriding-components-props) and/or using
  our [theming tools](/docs/customizing) to achieve the desired behavior without
  compromising the existing integration implemented in `@faststore/core`. You
  can find the available props for each component on the [Components
  UI](https://evergreen.faststore.dev/components).
</Callout>

4. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser and go to the product details page to see the `CustomBuyButton` replacing the previous `BuyButton` component:
