# Overriding Native Components and Props

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This documentation is currently being developed.
</Callout>

In this guide, you will learn how to modify a component's behavior using additional properties in your store code and create new components by overriding their native equivalents. 

These features are useful when you need a customized behavior for a specific component not available in the [FastStore native options](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-native-sections).


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  When overriding a component, it's important to note that you will lose the integration developed in [`@faststore/core`](/docs/getting-started/3-project-structure#faststorecore) for that component. To avoid compromising the existing integration, we highly recommend to consider [overriding props](#1-override-native-component-by-overriding-its-props) or utilizing the [theming tools](/docs/customizing/components) provided by `@faststore/core` to achieve the desired behavior. For more information about the available props for each component, refer to the [Components UI](/components) guide.

## Before you start

<Steps>
 
### Ensure you have a functioning FastStore project

Make sure you have a functioning FastStore project after following the [FastStore onboarding](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/overview) and [setting up the project](/docs/getting-started/2-setting-up-the-project).

### Choose a native section and the component you want to customize
 
The [`@faststore/core`](/docs/getting-started/3-project-structure#faststorecore) package provides a set of native sections, each consisting of different components with unique functionalities.
Refer to the [List of native sections and overridable components](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-native-sections#faststore-native-sections) to explore available native sections.
 
 ### Consider two aspects for this feature
 Keep in mind the following aspects when using this feature:

 
- **This feature is experimental**: The feature may not function as expected.

- **Some sections contain multiple instances of the same component**: When overriding a component or passing additional props to it, consider that all instances will be affected by this change.


</Steps>

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Setting up the `overrides` folder

1. Choose a native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-available-native-sections).
2. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
3. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder and inside it, create the `overrides` folder.

```bash
mkdir src/components src/components/overrides
```

4. Inside the `overrides` folder, create a new file named after the chosen native section. For example, if you chose the `ProductDetails` section for customization, create a new file named `ProductDetails.tsx` under the `src/components/overrides` directory.

```bash
touch src/components/overrides/ProductDetails.tsx
```

5. Copy and paste the following code snippet into the file:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = { section: SECTION, components: {} }

export { override }
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Change the value of the `SECTION` variable to the name of the section you want
  to override. In the given example, we set the `SECTION` variable to
  `ProductDetails` to override this specific section.
</Callout>

6. Save your changes. We will use this file later.

## 1. Override native component's props

Overriding props allows you to customize a component's behavior without modifying the integration built for the native component.
This approach is particularly useful when you want to change specific aspects of a native component while preserving its integration.

All component customizations in FastStore are done within a section, so choose the native section and component you wish to override its props.
You can check the available native sections and its overridable components in the [List of available native sections](/tbd).
After knowing which components can be overridable, you can find the list of props for this component in our documentation.

For this guide, we'll use the `BuyButton` component and you can find the list of this component's props on the [BuyButton component documentation](/components/molecules/buy-button#props).

Here's how the initial component looks like with the `size` prop set as `regular` in the PDP (Product Details Page):

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-initial](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-pdp-buy-button-initial___a4b7ae9d88ed888da5649b2b6cc1eecd.png)

### Step by step

1. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file created in the [previoulsy step](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder) and add the following code:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { props: { size: 'small', iconPosition: 'right' } },
  },
}

export { override }
```

This code will override the `BuyButton` props `size` and `iconPosition`. You'll see a smaller button than the initial one, and the cart icon positioned on the right side.

2. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser and go to product details page to see the updated `BuyButton` component:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-props](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-pdp-buy-button-props___898b016bd82c908b5b24c8822be6789a.png)

## 2. Overriding a native component

Now that you know how to override a component's prop, you will learn how to override a native component to use a custom component.

For example, you may want to replace the current `BuyButton` component from the `ProductDetails` section to meet your business needs.

Currently, when the `BuyButton` is clicked, it opens the `CartSideBar` as its default behavior:

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-cart___a5853a88238fa31610a93e8a1333bb00.gif)

### Step by step

#### Step 1 - Create your custom component

1. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CustomBuyButton.tsx`. (If you haven't created the `components` folder yet, see the [previous step](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder))

```bash
touch src/components/CustomBuyButton.tsx
```

2. Copy and paste the following code into `CustomBuyButton.tsx` file:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'

export function CustomBuyButton() {
  return (
    <UIButton
      variant="primary"
      onClick={() => {
        alert('Hello User!')
      }}
    >
      New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

The code above imports the Button component from the [@faststore/ui](/components) package, and creates a `CustomBuyButton` component that, when clicked opens an alert. You can create any component as you wish.

#### Step 2 - Overriding the component

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components of each native section](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-native-sections). In this example, we are overriding the `BuyButton` component in the `ProductDetails` section.
2. Navigate to `src/components/overrides` that we've created [before](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#step-1---setting-up-the-overrides-folder).
3. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file and update it with the following code:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'
import { CustomBuyButton } from '../CustomBuyButton'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails' as const

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { Component: CustomBuyButton },
  },
}

export { override }
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **By overriding a component, you lose all the integration developed on
  [@faststore/core](docs/getting-started/project-structure#faststorecore) for
  that component.** We highly recommend trying first [overriding
  props](/docs/component-customization/overriding-components-props) and/or using
  our [theming tools](/docs/customizing) to achieve the desired behavior without
  compromising the existing integration implemented in `@faststore/core`. You
  can find the available props for each component on the [Components
  UI](https://evergreen.faststore.dev/components).
</Callout>

4. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser. Navigate to the product details page, you should see the CustomBuyButton component in place of the previous BuyButton component.

![overrides-PDP-buy-button-component-alert](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/overrides-buy-button-open-alert___b62f8cb5f3f98f6bd0f5502081de6a9b.gif)

## Extra: Overriding components and passing props

In certain scenarios, you may have the option to use prior integrations within your custom component.
Building upon our previous example, we could pass the `BuyButton` props to our new component.
This approach allows us to incorporate the icon and cart sidebar integration while also introducing additional functionality to the `onClick` function, such as triggering an alert or sending an event to analytics.

```tsx
//CustomBuyButton.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'

export function CustomBuyButton(props: any) {
  return (
    <UIButton
      {...props}
      variant="primary"
      onClick={(event) => {
        alert('You will love this product!')
        props?.onClick(event)
      }}
    >
      My New Buy Button
    </UIButton>
  )
}
```

But remember that this will only work if your custom component's props are compatible with the overriding component.

We believe this feature will open up numerous possibilities for exploration and customization in your store. Happy exploring! 🎉
