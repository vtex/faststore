## C 

### Content Type
The nature of pages created via the [VTEX Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-overview). 
A Landing Page, a Product Listing Page (PLP), and a Product Detail Page (PDP) are a few examples of different Content Types.

---

## D 

### Design tokens
Design elements that define the behavior and appearance of components in a store. 
There are two types: [global tokens](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/global-tokens/overview), which control system-wide interactions, and [local tokens](/docs/theming-overview#global-and-local-tokens), which customize individual components. 
By configuring both types, consistent visual styles can be maintained while allowing for customization at different levels.

With this app, you can easily configure essential store settings such as Catalog, CMS integration, and SEO tags.

## N

### Next.js

## O

### Override

---

## S

### Sections
React components that wrap up other components, facilitating the creation of cohesive and functional content for your storefront. For example, the [Hero](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-native-sections) section. In the context of the [Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-overview), sections are predefined and customizable content structures. They act as building blocks that can be populated with content, such as text, images, and media, allowing users to publish content more user-friendly and standardized. Integrating sections with a CMS streamlines the content creation process and ensures a consistent look and feel across different pages or sections of the storefront. 


### Static Site Generator (SSG)
A tool that interprets and transforms raw data and templates into a directory with plain HTML pages and static assets. 
In other words, an SSG automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and prepares those pages in advance for serving to users.

---

## T
### Theming
The process of customizing the apperance of a store by using CSS stylesheets known as [themes](/docs/getting-started-glossary#themes). 

### Themes
Collections of configurable design tokens that define the look and feel of the store's UI

## V

### (VTEX) Headless CMS
[VTEX Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-overview) is a no-code management system for creating, editing and publishing web pages. 
It delivers content data to headless applications through an intermediary data layer decoupled from the frontend.
