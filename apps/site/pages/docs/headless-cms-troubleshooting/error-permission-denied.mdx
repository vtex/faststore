# Permission denied error while running `faststore cms-sync`
</header>

If you encounter a `Error: Permission denied` when using `vtex cms sync`, this issue is not related to the plugin version but rather to the user's permissions needed to execute the command and save resources.
To resolve this issue, ask the person who conceived your user Admin access and follow these steps:

1. Open the VTEX Admin, go to **Account Settings > User Roles.**

2. Under **Roles**, select the role associated with the user requiring CMS permissions, for example **Owner (Admin Super)**.

3. In **Products and Resources**, find and click **CMS**.
