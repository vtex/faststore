# Permission denied error while running `faststore cms-sync`
</header>

If you encounter a `Error: Permission denied` or `Error: User indicated by VtexIdclientAutCookie is not authorized to access the indicated resource.` when using `faststore cms-sync` or `vtex cms sync`, this issue is not related to the plugin version but rather to the user's permissions needed to execute the command and save resources.
To resolve this issue, ask the person who conceived your user Admin access and follow these steps:

1. Open the VTEX Admin, go to **Account Settings > User Roles.**

2. Under **Roles**, select the role associated with the user requiring CMS permissions, for example **Owner (Admin Super)**.

3. In **Products and Resources**, find and click **CMS**.

4. Ensure both **See CMS menu on the top-bar** and **Settings** are checked.

5. In the same page, navigate to the section **Users** and add the email from the person who needs to access the CMS.

6. Click `Save`. Ask the person to try to run the `faststore cms-sync` or `vtex cms sync` again and they should be able to sync their changes.
