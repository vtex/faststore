# Error installing the Headless CMS plugin of VTEX IO CLI
</header>

If you are a Windows user, you may find the following error after requesting to install the Headless CMS plugin of VTEX IO CLI:

```
vtex plugins install cms
warning "@vtex/cli-plugin-cms > @vtex/api > apollo-server-core > apollo-graphql@0.9.5" has incorrect peer dependency "graphql@^14.2.1 || ^15.0.0".
Installing plugin @vtex/cli-plugin-cms... failed
    Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink
    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\vtex' ->
    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Local\vtex\node_modules\vtex'
    Code: EPERM
```

To solve this issue, enable the [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers) in your machine.
Since FastStore projects rely on creating symbolic links (symlinks), this mode grants the necessary permissions and privileges, reducing the chance of errors during development. 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Running the FastStore project as an Administrator is not recommended.
</Callout>

1. To enable Developer Mode, refer to Microsoft's official guide on [Enabling your device for development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers).

2. After enabling the mode, launch the Windows Terminal and then, run `vtex cms`.


This will allow the system to create the symlinks necessary for running commands from the Headless CMS plugin.
