# Error installing the Headless CMS plugin of VTEX IO CLI
</header>

If you are a Windows user, you may find the following error after requesting to install the Headless CMS plugin of VTEX IO CLI:

```
vtex plugins install cms
warning "@vtex/cli-plugin-cms > @vtex/api > apollo-server-core > apollo-graphql@0.9.5" has incorrect peer dependency "graphql@^14.2.1 || ^15.0.0".
Installing plugin @vtex/cli-plugin-cms... failed
    Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink
    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\vtex' ->
    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Local\vtex\node_modules\vtex'
    Code: EPERM
```

To solve this issue, enable the [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers) in your machine.
Since FastStore projects rely on creating symbolic links (symlinks), this mode grants the necessary permissions and privileges, reducing the chance of errors during development. 

1. To enable Developer Mode, refer to Microsoft's official guide on [Enabling your device for development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers).

2. After enabling the mode, launch the Windows Terminal and then, run `vtex cms`.


This will allow the system to create the symlinks necessary for running commands from the Headless CMS plugin.
