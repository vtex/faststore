# Enabling Cypress extension

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This is an experimental feature.
</Callout>

The `enableCypressExtension` experimental feature flag allows you to leverage [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) extensions within your FastStore project, enabling you to seamlessly run custom Cypress tests.

Cypress extensions enhance the testing capabilities of your Faststore project by enabling the incorporation of custom Cypress tests alongside the native integration tests provided by Faststore.

With `enableCypressExtension`, you can implement custom integration tests into a dedicated Cypress folder within your storefront project. This integration ensures the smooth execution of both the native tests and the custom ones you create as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
Learn how to add custom integration tests in the following steps.

## Before you begin

- Please be aware that this feature is experimental and may not be suitable for all use cases.

- Refer to [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) for more information on this testing tool.

- Ensure that you are using `@faststore/core` and `@faststore/cli` version 2.1.56 or above. If you are using a previous version, take the following steps:
  1. In your storefront project, open the `package.json` file.
  2. Navigate to the `@faststore/core` and `@faststore/cli` dependencies and and update their versions to be at least `2.1.56`.
  3. Run `yarn install` to apply these changes.

## Step 1: Enabling `enableCypressExtension`

1. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
2. Add the `experimental` object with the `enableCypressExtension` as it property.
3. Set the `enableCypressExtension` value to `true`:

```js filename="faststore.config.js" {2-4}
  },
  experimental: {
      enableCypressExtension: true,
  }
```

## Step 2: Integrating custom Cypress tests into your FastStore project

1. In the root directory of your storefront project, create a new folder named `cypress`.
2. Add your custom integration tests within the `cypress` folder. 
3. Open a pull request with the changes you have made.
4. Within the pull request, navigate to **Checks > Integration Tests** and check the **Details** section.

5. Review the results to check the execution status of your custom integration tests.
