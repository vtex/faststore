# Enabling Cypress extension

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This is an experimental feature.
</Callout>

The `enableCypressExtension` experimental feature flag allows you to leverage [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) extensions within your FastStore project, enabling you to seamlessly run custom Cypress tests.

Cypress extensions enhance the testing capabilities of your Faststore project by enabling the incorporation of custom Cypress tests alongside the native integration tests provided by Faststore.

With `enableCypressExtension`, you can implement custom integration tests into a dedicated Cypress folder within your storefront project. This integration ensures the smooth execution of both the native tests and the custom ones you create as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
Learn how to add custom integration tests in the following steps.

---

## Before you begin

- Please be aware that this feature is experimental and may not be suitable for all use cases.

- Refer to [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) for more information on this testing tool.

- Ensure you are using `@faststore/core` `2.1.56` version or above and `@faststore/cli` version `2.2.9` or above. If you have versions lower than these requirements, update them as follows:
  1. In your storefront project, open the `package.json` file.
  2. Navigate to the `@faststore/core` and update it to at least `2.1.56`.
  3. Navigate to the `@faststore/cli` and update it to at least `2.2.9`.
  4. Run `yarn dev` to apply these changes.

---

## Step 1: Enabling `enableCypressExtension`

1. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
2. Add the `experimental` object with the `enableCypressExtension` as it property.
3. Set the `enableCypressExtension` value to `true`:

```js filename="faststore.config.js" {2-4}
  },
  experimental: {
      enableCypressExtension: true,
  }
```

## Step 2: Integrating custom Cypress tests into your FastStore project

Like any other project using Cypress, you'll follow standard practices, including setting up standard Cypress folders and configuration files. This allows you to seamlessly add and execute your custom integration tests within your project. For further details on Cypress configuration, refer to the official [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) guide.

1. In the root directory of your storefront project, create a new folder named `cypress`.
2. Add your custom integration tests within the `cypress/integration` folder.
3. With the local server running, run `yarn test` to open the Cypress app and to check your tests execution.
4. Open a pull request with the changes you have made.
5. Within the pull request, navigate to **Checks > Integration Tests** and check the **Details** section.

6. Review the results to check the execution status of your custom integration tests.

## Running only custom Cypress tests in FastStore projects

As storefront projects evolve, changes to component and page code may lead to errors in the default end-to-end tests conducted for all FastStore projects.

In such cases, you can override FastStore's default tests using custom tests with the same name as the original test files. For example:

```js filename="plp.test.js"
import { cypress } from '../../faststore.config'

const { pages } = cypress

describe('Custom PLP tests', () => {
  it('visit collection page', () => {
    cy.visit(pages.collection)
    cy.get('[data-testid="product-gallery"]').should('exist').and('be.visible')
  })
})
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Although exclusive execution of custom tests is possible for projects using Cypress version 12.x, we do not recommend this approach. If possible, keep the default Cypress tests.
</Callout>

Some projects may prefer exclusive execution of its custom Cypress tests. Although it is not our recommendation, for projects using Cypress version 12.x or higher there is the possibility of running the **Integration Tests** check only for your custom tests.

Follow the steps below to configure your project to only run custom Cypress tests:

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Setting Cypress version

First, ensure that you use Cypress version 12 by setting the `cypressVersion` experimental feature flag:

1. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
2. Inside the `experimental` object, add the `cypressVersion` property.
3. Set the `cypressVersion` value to `12`.

```js filename="faststore.config.js" {4}
  },
  experimental: {
      enableCypressExtension: true,
      cypressVersion: 12,
  }
```

### Step 2 - Updating the Cypress configuration file

Ensure that your Cypress configuration file (`cypress.json`) matches the latest Cypress configuration file format. To do so, refer to the official [Cypress configuration file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) guide.

### Step 3 - Changing the custom Cypress tests directory

Now, change your custom Cypress tests directory from `cypress/integration` to `cypress/e2e`:

1. In your storefront project, rename the folder from `cypress/integration` to `cypress/e2e`.
2. Update your new Cypress configuration file `cypress.config.ts` to match the new custom tests folder `cypress/e2e` by specifying the `specPattern`:

```ts filename="cypress.config.ts" {7}
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  ...,
  e2e: {
    ...,
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
  },
})
```

3. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to sync the changes you have made.
