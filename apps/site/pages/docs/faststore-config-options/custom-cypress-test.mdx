The `enableCypressExtension` feature flag allows you to utilize Cypress extensions within your FastStore project for running customized Cypress tests seamlessly.

Cypress extensions enhance the testing capabilities of your Faststore project by enabling the incorporation of custom Cypress tests alongside the default tests provided by Faststore.

By default, Faststore includes standard integration tests for your store and with `enableCypressExtension`, you can integrate custom integration tests into a dedicated Cypress root folder within your store's codebase. 
This integration ensures that both the conventional integration tests and your personalized tests are executed seamlessly as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.


## Step 1: Enabling `enableCypressExtension` 

1. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
2. Add the `experimental` object with the `enableCypressExtension` as it paramether.
3. Add the value `true` to the `enableCypressExtension`:

```js {2-4}
     },
    experimental: {
        enableCypressExtension: true,
  }
```

## Step 2: Creating the Cypress folder

1. In the root directory of your store, create a new folder named `cypress`.
2. Add your custom integration tests to the folder.
3. Open a pull request with the changes you made.
4. In the pull request, go to **checks > Integration Tests** and click **Details**.
5. Check the results to see your custom integrations tests.
