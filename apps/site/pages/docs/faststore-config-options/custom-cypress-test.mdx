# Enabling Cypress extension

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This is an experimental feature.
</Callout>

The `enableCypressExtension` experimental feature flag allows you to leverage Cypress extensions within your FastStore project, enabling you to run custom [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests seamlessly.

Cypress extensions enhance the testing capabilities of your Faststore project by enabling the incorporation of custom Cypress tests alongside the default integration tests provided by Faststore.

With `enableCypressExtension`, you can integrate custom integration tests into a dedicated Cypress folder within your store's codebase. This integration ensures that both the default
tests and the custom ones you create are executed seamlessly as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
Learn how to add custom integration tests in the following steps.

---

## Before you start

- Please note that this feature is experimental.

- Ensure that you are using `@faststore/core` and `@faststore/cli` version 2.1.56 or above. If you have a version that is lower than this requirement, change the following:
  1. In your store code, open the `package.json` file.
  2. Navigate to the `@faststore/core` and `@faststore/cli` and and update them to be at least `2.1.56`.
  3. Run `yarn dev` to update your changes.

## Step 1: Enabling `enableCypressExtension`

1. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
2. Add the `experimental` object with the `enableCypressExtension` as it property.
3. Set the `enableCypressExtension` value to `true`:

```js filename="faststore.config.js" {2-4}
  },
  experimental: {
      enableCypressExtension: true,
  }
```

## Step 2: Integrating custom Cypress tests into your FastStore project

1. In the root directory of your store, create a new folder named `cypress`.
2. Add your custom integration tests within the `cypress` folder.
3. Open a pull request with the changes you have made.
4. Within the pull request, navigate to **Checks > Integration Tests** and see **Details**.

5. Review the results to check the execution status of your custom integration tests.
