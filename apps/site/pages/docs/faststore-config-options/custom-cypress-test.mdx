The `enableCypressExtension` feature flag allows you to utilize Cypress extensions within your FastStore project for running customized Cypress tests seamlessly.

Cypress extensions enhance the testing capabilities of your Faststore project by enabling the incorporation of custom Cypress tests alongside the default tests provided by Faststore.

By default, Faststore includes standard integration tests for your store and with `enableCypressExtension`, you can integrate custom integration tests into a dedicated Cypress root folder within your store's codebase. 
This integration ensures that both the conventional integration tests and your personalized tests are executed seamlessly as part of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.


## Step 1: Enabling `enableCypressExtension` 

1. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
2. Add the `experimental` object with the `enableCypressExtension` as it parameter.
3. Set the `enableCypressExtension` value to `true` to:

```js {2-4}
     },
    experimental: {
        enableCypressExtension: true,
  }
```

## Step 2: Integrating custom Cypress tests into Your FastStore project

1. In the root directory of your store, create a new folder named `cypress`.
2. Add your custom integration tests within the folder.
3. Open a pull request with the changes you have made.
4. Within the pull request, navigate to **checks > Integration Tests** and click **Details**.
5. Review the results to check the execution status of your custom integration tests.
