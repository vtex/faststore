# Part 2: Setting up the VTEX Headless CMS in your FastStore project
</header>

Now that you are familiar with the core concepts of the **VTEX Headless CMS** and have set it up in your VTEX account, let's get back to our **FastStore** project to define our own **Content Types** and **Sections**.

By the end of this part of this tutorial, you will be able to see your first definition of a Content Type available for use at the VTEX Headless CMS app. Next, we will dive deeper into how to create these definitions in a smoother way.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Creating the CMS folder

1. Open the terminal and change to the root directory of your FastStore project.
2. Create a new folder named `cms` at the root of your FastStore project:

    ```bash
    mkdir cms
    ```

3. Inside the `cms` folder, create a folder for your project:

    ```bash
    cd cms
    mkdir faststore
    ```
4. Inside the `faststore` folder, create the three following files:

    - `content-types.json` - an array of JSON objects that describes the **Content Types** available for customization at the VTEX Headless CMS app.
    - `sections.json` - an array of JSON objects that describes the content structure of the frontend **Section** components available for customization at the VTEX Headless CMS app.
    - `translation-keys.json` - an array of JSON objects that defines the translation keys of the Sections descriptions.

    ```bash
    touch cms/faststore/content-types.json cms/faststore/sections.json cms/faststore/translation-keys.json
    ```

5. Update the `sections.json` file with an empty array:

   ```bash
   echo "[]" > cms/faststore/sections.json
   ```
6. Update the `translation-keys.json` file with an empty object:
   ```
   echo "{}" > cms/faststore/translation-keys.json
   ```

  Once you have the 1.0.7 version of @vtex/cli-plugin-cms it is possible to specify the builder that you want to synchronize.  To do that you should update with the    command ```vtex plugins update``` and create a folder to each one of the builders to be able to specify it. Example: cms/faststore/content-types.json"
:::

7. Now, open the `content-types.json` file in any code editor of your choice and add the following code:

   ```json filename="cms/faststore/content-types.json" copy 
    [
      {
        "id": "home",
        "name": "Home Page",
        "configurationSchemaSets": []
      },
      {
        "id": "institutionalPage",
        "name": "Institutional page",
        "configurationSchemaSets": [
          {
            "name": "SEO",
            "configurations": [
              {
                "name": "siteMetadataWithSlug",
                "schema": {
                  "title": "Site Metadata",
                  "description": "Configure global site metadata",
                  "type": "object",
                  "widget": {
                    "ui:ObjectFieldTemplate": "GoogleSeoPreview"
                  },
                  "properties": {
                    "title": {
                      "title": "Default page title",
                      "description": "Display this title when no other tile is available",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "Store Theme | VTEX SFJ"
                    },
                    "description": {
                      "title": "Meta tag description",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "A beautifully designed site for general VTEX stores"
                    },
                    "titleTemplate": {
                      "title": "Title template to be used in category/product pages",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "%s | Store Theme"
                    },
                    "slug": {
                      "title": "URL Slug",
                      "type": "string",
                      "default": "/landing-page-url"
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```
