  # Part 1: Configuring your VTEX account with the VTEX Headless CMS
</header>

Let's set up all the tools you need to integrate the VTEX Headless CMS with your FastStore project. First, we will install the **VTEX IO CLI**.
The VTEX IO CLI will help you during your development process by allowing you to perform different actions in the VTEX platform. In the following, we will install and configure the VTEX Headless CMS app in your VTEX account.

---

## Before you start

Before you proceed with setting up the Headless CMS in your account, please ensure the following:

**1. Successful FastStore Onboarding**

Make sure that the FastStore Onboarding process has been completed successfully. The VTEX Headless CMS is installed during this onboarding phase. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Starting a new FastStore project](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/onboarding#step-1-setting-up-the-project) tutorial.

**2. Installation of VTEX IO CLI**

Ensure that you have installed the VTEX IO CLI on your machine. This CLI is required to install the Headless CMS plugins and CMS dependencies. For more information, please refer to the [Installing VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install) guide.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Setting up the command-line environment

1. Access the VTEX IO CLI and Log in to your VTEX account:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Remember to replace the values between curly brackets according to your
  account name.
</Callout>

```bash copy
vtex login {account}
```

2. Install the VTEX Headless CMS plugin:

```bash copy
vtex plugins install cms
```

Now, check if the installation of the VTEX Headless CMS plugin was successful by running `vtex cms`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  <li>**Windows user**</li>: if you find problems while installing
  the plugin, please refer to the
  [Troubleshooting](/docs/headless-cms-troubleshooting/error-installing-headless-cms)
  article.
  <li>**macOS user**</li>: if you find problems, run `yarn config set ignore-engines true` to ignore the node incompatibility versions, then run `vtex plugins install cms` again.
</Callout>

### Step 2 - Installing the Headless CMS dependencies on your VTEX account

Install the VTEX Headless CMS dependencies in your VTEX account by running the following command:

```bash copy
 vtex install vtex.admin-cms-graphql@0.x vtex.admin-cms-graphql-rc@1.x
```

### Step 3 - Configuring the Headless CMS

Let's configure the URLs of the webhooks used by the VTEX Headless CMS app.

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Extensions Hub > App Management**
2. Search for the **CMS (alpha)** app and click on **Settings**.
3. Expand the pre-filled item, **Item # 0**, which is automatically created during the [FastStore Onboarding](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/overview) process for your project.
4. If you're using the VTEX CI/CD, you must fill in the **Build Webhook URL** field with the following value. _Replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._

   ```sh copy
   https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.cms-builder-sf-jamstack/v1/{account}/{workspace}/build-releases
   ```

   ![cms-settings](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/cms-alpha-settings___5ec952c685b0e9c70d47378e6718a0d1.png)

<Callout type="info" emoji=" ℹ️ ">
  When an editor clicks to publish a page using the VTEX Headless CMS interface,
  the CMS calls the **Build Webhook URL**, which changes the status of that page
  to `publishing`. The CMS, then, waits for the content to be built in the
  background.
</Callout>

5. Fill in the **Production base URL** filed with your production URL. _Replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._

```
https://{account}.vtex.com/
```

6. Click on **SAVE**

### Step 4 - Communicating WebOps updates to the Headless CMS

Now, if you are developing your FastStore project with CI/CD and VTEX Headless CMS, you must ensure that CI/CD is aware of every CMS update performed via the VTEX Admin. To do so, you must configure the WebOps webhooks responsible for communicating with the VTEX Headless CMS as in the following.

1. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Edit the `faststore.config.js` file in the root directory of your project.
3. In the VTEX Headless CMS configuration, add the `webhookUrls` property corresponding to your store website as in the following:

   ```js filename="faststore.config.js" copy
    "vtexHeadlessCms": {
      webhookUrls: [
        "https://{account}.myvtex.com/cms-releases/webhook-releases"
      ]
    }
   ```

4. Open a Pull Request in your project including the previous changes.
5. Merge the Pull Request.

Now you can make changes to the Headless CMS and check if commits are being created in the project. In the following example, the `Hero` title was modified to `10% off on first purchase`, and we can see that it generated a commit in the repository.
