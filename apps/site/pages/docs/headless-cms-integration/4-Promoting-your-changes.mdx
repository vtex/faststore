# Part 4: Promoting your changes
</header>

In this last part of this track, let's guarantee you promote your changes to production.
If you are happy with your Content type and Section and definitions, you can put them on production by taking the following steps: 

1. Open the terminal and switch to the `master` workspace.

```bash copy
vtex use master
```

2. Change to the root directory of your FastStore project and sync your changes in the `cms` folder with the Headless CMS app.

```bash copy
faststore cms-sync
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your FastStore project is now completely integrated with Headless CMS, and editors will now have the autonomy to create, edit, and publish web content via the VTEX Admin with the Headless CMS app.
