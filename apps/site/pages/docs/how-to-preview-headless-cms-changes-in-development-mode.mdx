# How to preview Headless CMS changes in development mode

 </header>

To make local tests, you can use the `dev mode` of the Headless CMS
to see a preview of your changes.

  While this guide is applicable to other frontend projects within the Headless
  CMS, the use case for this guide is for FastStore projects.
</Callout>

1. After making changes to your FastStore project directory and syncing them with the Headless CMS,
   access the VTEX Admin and navigate to **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
2. Ensure you are in your FastStore project and the server is running.
3. Open the **Developer Tool** or right-click on the page and choose **Inspect**.
4. In the Developer Tool terminal, run the following command:

```bash copy
localStorage.setItem('cmsDevMode', 1)
```

5. Refresh the page and you should see the section **Development Mode** in the right sidebar.

6. Click on `Preview`. A new tab will open; copy the link from this tab containing the
   `contentType`, `documentId` and `versionId`. The link should be similar to the
   following:

```
https://faststore.vtex.app/?contentType=page&documentId=bd9e01d6-534e-4e54-aa76-f864dcbad024&versionId=405118e9-7509-11ed-83ab-0eeee363631w
```

7. Now, access the preview link locally and change the parameters accordingly:

```copy
localhost:3000/api/preview/?contentType=<contentType>&documentId=<DOCUMENT_ID>&versionId=<VERSION_ID>
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Ensure you replace `<contentType>`, `<DOCUMENT_ID>`, and `<VERSION_ID>` with the actual values from your preview link.
</Callout>
Given the previous example, the local preview link should be the following:

```
localhost:3000/api/preview/?contentType= page&documentId=bd9e01d6-534e-4e54-aa76-f864dcbad024&versionId=405118e9-7509-11ed-83ab-0eeee363631w
```

8. Once you have reviewed your changes, terminate the development mode by accessing the Headless CMS page you've changed.
   Open the terminal in the `Developer Tools` and run
   the following:

```bash copy
localStorage.removeItem('cmsDevMode')
```

9. Refresh the page and the development mode session is now ended.
