# API Extensions

In this guide, you will learn how to use the FastStore API Extension.

</header>

The [FastStore API](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/faststore-api) provides a [GraphQL schema](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/queries) that comprehends the basic use cases for an e-commerce. Some stores might need to access other information, be it provided by VTEX's APIs or third-party APIs. In order to be able to consume those APIs we allow the extension of FastStore's GraphQL layer.

In this document you'll learn how to:

1. Define which new fields will be exposed by the FastStore API Extension.
2. Determine the GraphQL fragments where these fields will be used.
3. How to consume the new fields using [New Sections](/docs/building-sections/creating-a-new-section) or [Custom Overridable Components](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#overriding-a-native-component).

  **Before you start:**

  Even though you can add information to the FastStore API schema, you must be careful not to over-fetch data on your pages. See the [best practices for fetching data on your storefront](https://v1.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/faststore-api/fetching-api-data#fetch-only-the-data-you-need).

## Defining VTEX APIs schema extensions

FastStore streamlines the way of using data from VTEX APIs that the FastStore API does not expose. As FastStore uses GraphQL, it's required to write [type definitions](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) and [resolvers](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers) to fetch the data you need.

### Folder Structure

To declare a new type definition and resolver you need to create a directory structure like the one below.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
  Please note that the `src/graphql/vtex/resolvers` and `src/graphql/vtex/typeDefs` path is mandatory, but you can organize the files inside those directory as you wish.
</Callout>

```ts copy
starter.store/
└─ src/
    └─ graphql/
        └─ vtex/
          ├─ resolvers/
              └─ index.ts
              └─ <resolverName>.ts
              └─ …
          ├─ typeDefs/
              └─<typeName>.graphql
              └─ …
```

### TypeDefs

Your new type definitions set the data structure for your new fields, extended from the existing FastStore API GraphQL queries and types.

You can create new `<typeName>.graphql` files inside the `vtex/typeDefs` folder. The way that it will be organized inside this folder is flexible, it's possible to create multiple typeDefs files or group them all together in just one file. During the build process and when running the local server file, all `.graphql` files under this directory will be considered.

See the following code example that creates a `product.graphql` file, that extends the [StoreProduct](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/objects#storeproduct) type from FastStore API and exposes a new `customData` field:

```graphql filename="graphql/vtex/typeDefs/product.graphql"

extend type StoreProduct {
  """
  Custom data extending StoreProduct
  """
  customData: String!
}

```

Please note that the typeDefs files must have `.graphql` extension, and the `index.ts` is not needed for typeDefs, only for resolvers.

### Resolvers

Resolvers are the functions that will provide the data you have declared in the type definitions. This means a resolver will be executed when the corresponding piece of information is queried. These resolvers can perform an operation on an existing field, get data from the Root param, or fetch data from VTEX APIs, for example.

New resolvers should be created inside the `src/graphql/vtex/resolvers` folder. The way that files will be organized inside this folder is up to you, it's possible to create multiple resolver files or group them all together in just one file.

See the following code example that creates a `product.ts` resolver file and resolves the `customData` field from `StoreProduct`:

```ts copy filename="graphql/vtex/resolvers/product.ts"

import type { StoreProductRoot } from '@faststore/core/api'

const productResolver = {
  StoreProduct: {
    customData: (root: StoreProductRoot) => {
      return 'My item id: ' + root.itemId
    },
  },
}

export default productResolver
```

As you see, you can leverage the use of TypeScript by typing the root param as [StoreProductRoot](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/root-object-fields#root-product):

![using-root-field-type](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/root-field-ts___3a10ec8a1aeba9770c7ee982995d55bc.gif)

Then, it's important to import the resolvers inside the `index.ts` file, spread them in the resolver object and re-export the final resolver object.

```ts copy filename="graphql/vtex/resolvers/index.ts"

import { default as StoreProductResolver } from './product'

const resolvers = {
  ...StoreProductResolver,
}

export default resolvers
```

That's it! Once you have defined these files in the `vtex` folder, the new fields are already exposed. The entire GraphQL creation process is automated and handled in the background by the FastStore CLI.

## Defining third-party APIs schema extensions

Also, as stores tend to grow, so does the possibility of consuming new data that is **not provided by default in the FastStore API or other VTEX APIs**. As such, FastStore must consume new data from third-party APIs.

Intending to separate what comes from VTEX and what comes from third-party APIs. The store's repository provides the following folder structure for third-party APIs schema Extensions that are held in the `src/graphql/thirdParty` folder:

```ts copy
starter.store/
└── src/
    └── graphql/
        ├── thirdParty/
        │   ├── resolvers/
        │       └── index.ts
        │       └── <resolverName>.ts
        │       └── …
        │   ├── typeDefs/
        │       └── <typeName>.graphql
        │       └── …
```

Following this structure, you can use the same pattern mentioned above regarding the VTEX API Schema extensions but using the `thirdParty` folder, with resolvers and typeDefs inside their respective folders and resolvers being imported into the `index.ts` file.

You can extend the [FastStore API Objects](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/objects) as mentioned in the previous section, or even create new Queries entry points to access data.
Below, you will find an example of the implementation of a third-party extension using new queries:

```ts copy filename="graphql/thirdParty/typeDefs/extra.graphql"

type ExtraData {
  """
  Data customizing ExtraData
  """
  data: String!
}

type Query {
  extraData: ExtraData
  namedExtraData(name: String!): ExtraData
}
```

```ts copy filename="graphql/thirdParty/resolvers/extra.ts"

const extraDataResolver = {
  Query: {
    extraData: () => {
      return {
        data: 'Extra data',
      }
    },
    namedExtraData: (_, { name }) => {
      return {
        data: `Named extra data: ${name}`,
      }
    },
  },
}

export default extraDataResolver
```

```ts copy filename="graphql/thirdParty/resolvers/index.ts"

import { default as StoreExtraResolver } from './extra'

const resolvers = {
  ...StoreExtraResolver,
}

export default resolvers
```

In this example, you can fetch the extra data by using these queries inside the fragments from the next section:

```ts copy
query {
	extraData {
		data
	}
	namedExtraData(name: "Hello") {
		data
	}
}
```

---

## Extending queries using fragments

Once, you define which new fields will be exposed by the FastStore API Extension, it's time to determine the GraphQL fragments where these fields will be used.

Fragments are GraphQL components that can be integrated into queries to extend functionality.

FastStore maps the existing queries used on its pages to corresponding fragments which are used to spread the new fields exposed.

You can see the list of queries and their fragments in the [extendable queries](/docs/api-extensions#extendable-queries) section.

To add custom fields to existing [extendable queries](/docs/api-extensions#extendable-queries), extend them using fragments located in the `src/fragments` folder.

In the steps below, we will use the `ServerProductPage` fragment as an example to illustrate how to extend a query.

### Step 1: Create a new file
Create a new `.ts` file in the `src/fragments` folder named `ServerProductPage.ts`. _The name of the file should match the name of the query you want to extend._

### Step 2: Define the GraphQL fragment
In the `ServerProductPage.ts` file, define the GraphQL fragment corresponding to the new fields you want. In this example, the new field is represented by `customData` field from the product query. Use the following syntax as a guideline:

```ts copy filename="src/fragments/ServerProductPage.ts"

import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'

export const fragment = gql`
  fragment ServerProductPage on Query {
    product(locator: $locator) {
      customData
    }
  }
`
```

## How to consume FastStore API Extension


Once you define which new fields will be exposed by the FastStore API Extension, then determine the GraphQL fragments where these fields will be used.
Finally, it's time to know how to consume the new fields in your [New Sections](/docs/building-sections/creating-a-new-section) or [Custom Overridable Components](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props).

It's important to know that FastStore exposes the data that comes from FastStore API along with FastStore API Extensions inside a provider called `PageProvider`.
This data comes as a `context` in `PageProvider`, and you can use some hooks to access it:

The `usePDP()` hook is recommendable in cases where you use your section on PDP.

```ts copy
import { usePDP } from "@faststore/core"

const context = usePDP()
```

The `usePLP()` hook is recommendable in cases where you use your section on PLP.

```ts copy
import { usePLP } from "@faststore/core"

const context = usePLP()
```

The `useSearchPage()` hook is recommendable in cases where you use your section on the Search Page.

```ts copy
import { useSearchPage } from "@faststore/core"

const context = useSearchPage()
```

The `usePage()` hook is recommendable in cases where you have one section that is used in more than one type of page.

```ts copy
import { usePage } from "@faststore/core"

const context = usePage()
```

This hook returns one of the following types as context: `PDPContext`, `PLPContext`, or `SearchPageContext`, and you can decide how to handle it depending on the page that will use this hook by passing the types as generics.

```ts copy
import { usePage } from "@faststore/core"

const context = usePage<PLPContext | SearchPageContext>()
```

Also, you can use type assertion functions so that you can leverage the use of typescript and get the correct types

```ts copy
import { isPDP, isPLP, isSearchPage } from "@faststore/core";

isPDP(context)
isPLP(context)
isSearchPage(context)
```

### Consuming API Extensions data from new `Sections`

Creates a new section using the [Creating a New Section](/docs/building-sections/creating-a-new-section) doc, and uses one of the hooks mentioned above.
This example represents the `CallToAction` section inside a PLP.

```ts copy
import { usePLP }  from "@faststore/core";

export interface CallToActionProps {
  title: string
  link: {
    text: string
    url: string
  }
}

export default function CallToAction(props: CallToActionProps) {
  const context = usePLP()
  return (
    <section>
      <h2>{`${props.title} ${context?.data?.namedExtraData?.data}`}</h2>
    </section>
  )
}
```

You can also import the `useProductsQuery` and use it inside your custom Sections. This hook fetches data from the [Search query](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/queries/search), and uses the `ClientProducts` fragment to extend API extensions.

```ts copy
import { useProductsQuery } from "@faststore/core"
```

### Consuming API Extensions data from custom components in `Section Overrides`

After [Overriding Native Components and Props](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#overriding-a-native-component), you can also use the hooks inside custom components.
In the following, the `CustomBuyButton` component overrides the native `BuyButton` component from the `ProductDetails` section inside the PDP.

```ts copy
import { Button as UIButton } from '@faststore/ui'
import { usePDP }  from "@faststore/core"

export function CustomBuyButton(props) {
  const context = usePDP()

  return (
    <UIButton
      variant="primary"
      onClick={() => {
        alert('Hello User!')
      }}
    >
      {context?.data?.product.customData}
    </UIButton>
  )
}

```
