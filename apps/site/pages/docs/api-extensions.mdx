# API extensions

In this guide you will learn how to extend the FastStore API schema.

</header>

Although the [FastStore API](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/faststore-api) provides a [GraphQL schema for ecommerce](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/queries) that suits a general use case, some stores may need to access other, more specific, information.

You will not be able to add other APIs endpoints to your storefront since this may [impact site performance](https://v1.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/faststore-api/fetching-api-data#best-practices-for-fetching-data). If you need to fetch more data, it is possible to extend the FastStore API schema, adding new data to the existing [queries](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/queries).

---

## Before you start

Note that even though you can add information to the FastStore API schema, you must be careful not to over-fetch data on your pages. See the [best practices for fetching data on your storefront](https://v1.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/faststore-api/fetching-api-data#best-practices-for-fetching-data).

As stores grow, so does the possibility of using data from VTEX APIs that the FastStore API does not expose.
Another possibility is to use data that is provided by third-party APIs. In both cases, FastStore provides these features by using API Extensions.

Inside the repository, there is a clear separation about what comes from VTEX APIs and what comes from third-party APIs. First, let's take a look in the VTEX APIs Schema extension possibility.

---

## VTEX APIs schema extensions

FastStore streamline the way of using data from VTEX APIs that the FastStore API does not expose.

As FastStore uses GraphQL, it's required to write [type definitions](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields) and [resolvers](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers) to fetch the data you need. You will learn how to do this using API Extensions by following the steps below.

### Folder Structure

The store's repository provides the following folder structure for the VTEX APIs Schema Extensions that is held in the `src/graphql/vtex` folder.

```ts copy
starter.store/
└─ src/
    └─ graphql/
        └─ vtex/
          ├─ resolvers/
              └─ index.ts
              └─ <resolverName>.ts
              └─ …
          ├─ typeDefs/
              └─<typeName>.graphql
              └─ …
```

### TypeDefs

Your new type definitions set the data structure for your new fields, extended from the existing FastStore API GraphQL queries and types.

You can create a new `<typeName>.graphql` files inside the `vtex/typeDefs` folder. The way that it will be organized inside this folder is flexible, it's possible to create multiple typeDefs files or group them all together in just one file.

See the following code example that creates a `product.graphql` file, that extends the [StoreProduct](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/objects#storeproduct) type from FastStore API and exposes a new `customData` field:

```graphql filename="graphql/vtex/typeDefs/product.graphql"

extend type StoreProduct {
  """
  Custom data extending StoreProduct
  """
  customData: String!
}

```

The typeDefs files must have `.graphql` extension.
Also, the `index.ts` is not needed for typeDefs, only for resolvers.

### Resolvers

Resolvers are the functions that give meaning to the data you have structured in the type definitions. This means a resolver will be executed when the corresponding piece of information is queried. These resolver can perform an operation on an existing field, get data from the Root param, or fetch data from VTEX APIs, for example.

You can create new `<resolverName>.ts` files inside the `vtex>resolvers` folder.

The way that it will be organized inside this folder is flexible, it's possible to create multiple resolvers files or group them all together in just one file.

See the following code example that creates a `product.ts` resolver file and resolves the `customData` field from `StoreProduct`:

```ts copy filename="graphql/vtex/resolvers/product.ts"

import type { StoreProductRoot } from '@faststore/api'

const productResolver = {
  StoreProduct: {
    customData: (root: StoreProductRoot) => {
      return 'My item id: ' + root.itemId
    },
  },
}

export default productResolver
```

As you see, you can leverage the use of TypeScript by typing the root param as [StoreProductRoot](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/root-object-fields#root-product):

![using-root-field-type](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/root-field-ts___3a10ec8a1aeba9770c7ee982995d55bc.gif)

Then, it's important to import the resolvers inside the `index.ts` file, spread them in the resolver object and re-export the final resolver object.

```ts copy filename="graphql/vtex/resolvers/index.ts"

import { default as StoreProductResolver } from './product'

const resolvers = {
  ...StoreProductResolver,
}

export default resolvers
```

That's it, you only need to define these files within the vtex folder for the sake of exposing the new fields. The entire GraphQL creation process must be transparent and done in the background by the FastStore.

### How to use

**TBD - After the Consume new fields from pages features be done. Here we can be inspired by these steps:**

1. add the `customData` field in the `Fragment X` from the `Y file`.
2. run `yarn dev` in the core package.
3. run `yarn generate` in the core package (with `yarn dev` running).
4. Get and use the `customData` as you want in Z section.

## Third-party APIs schema extensions

Also, as stores tend to grow, so does the possibility of consuming new data that is **not provided by default in the FastStore API or other VTEX APIs**. As such, FastStore must consume new data from third-party APIs.

Intending to separate what comes from VTEX and what comes from third-party APIs. The store's repository provides the following folder structure for third-party APIs Schema Extensions that is held in the `src/graphql/thirdParty` folder:

```ts copy
starter.store/
└── src/
    └── graphql/
        ├── thirdParty/
        │   ├── resolvers/
        │       └── index.ts
        │       └── <resolverName>.ts
        │       └── …
        │   ├── typeDefs/
        │       └── <typeName>.graphql
        │       └── …
```

Following this structure, you can use the same pattern mentioned above regarding the VTEX API Schema extensions but using the `thirdParty` folder, with resolvers and typeDefs inside their respective folders and resolvers being imported into the `index.ts` file.

One crucial aspect to consider when developing a third-party extension is the creation of a Query or Mutation schema. This schema plays a vital role in generating new query entry points to access data.
Below, you will find an example code the implementation of a third-party extension:

```ts copy filename="graphql/thirdParty/typeDefs/extra.graphql"

type ExtraData {
  """
  Data customizing ExtraData
  """
  data: String!
}

type Query {
  extraData: ExtraData
  namedExtraData(name: String!): ExtraData
}
```

```ts copy filename="graphql/thirdParty/resolvers/extra.ts"

const extraDataResolver = {
  Query: {
    extraData: () => {
      return {
        data: 'Extra data',
      }
    },
    namedExtraData: (_, { name }) => {
      return {
        data: `Named extra data: ${name}`,
      }
    },
  },
}

export default extraDataResolver
```

```ts copy filename="graphql/thirdParty/resolvers/index.ts"

import { default as StoreExtraResolver } from './extra'

const resolvers = {
  ...StoreExtraResolver,
}

export default resolvers
```

In this example, the extra data is accessible by this query:

```ts copy
query {
	extraData {
		data
	}
	namedExtraData(name: "Hello") {
		data
	}
}
```

## Extending queries using fragments

To add custom fields to existing [extendable queries](/docs/api-extensions#extendable-queries), extend them using fragments located in the `src/fragments` folder. Fragments are GraphQL components that can be integrated into queries to extend functionality.

To add additional fields to an existing query, follow the steps below. We will use the `ServerProductPage` query as an example to illustrate how to extend a query.

### Step 1: Create a new file
Create a new `.ts` file in the `src/fragments` folder named `ServerProductPage.ts`. _The name of the file should match the name of the query you want to extend._

### Step 2: Define the GraphQL fragment
In the `ServerProductPage.ts` file, define the GraphQL fragment corresponding to the new fields you want. In this example, the new field is represented by `customData` property to retrieve. Use the following syntax as a guideline:

{/*TO DO: ADD THE EXPECTED RESULT FROM THIS CODE SAMPLE*/}

```ts copy filename="src/fragments/ServerProductPage.ts"

import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'

export const fragment = gql`
  fragment ServerProductPage on Query {
    product(locator: $locator) {
      customData
    }
  }
`
```
