# API extension

</header>

In this track, learn how to extend the FastStore API schema by adding new
data to the existing [queries](/).

While the [FastStore API](/docs/faststore-api) provides a [GraphQL schema for ecommerce](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/queries) that covers a general use case, 
some stores may need to access other, more specific, information.

Note that adding additional API endpoints to your storefront can potentially impact site performance, as already covered in the guide
[Best practices for fetching data](https://v1.faststore.dev/how-to-guides/faststore-api/fetching-api-data#best-practices-for-fetching-data). 
If you need to retrieve more data, you can achieve this by extending the FastStore API schema and incorporating new data into the existing [queries](https://v1.faststore.dev/reference/api/queries).

## Main concepts

<ul>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary>GraphQL Optimizations & types</summary>
      GraphQL Optimizations are build-time generated mappings of the queries declared in a store.
      They enable the GraphQL server of the store to be more efficient and secure by enabling it to accepting only previously defined operations.
      Therefore, if these GraphQL optimizations are not generated, the changes in the GraphQL schema (new queries, addition or deletion a field from a query, changes in a GraphQL type) are not reflected in the store.
      Changes in resolvers are always visible automatically and don't require generating the optimizations to see them.

      At the same time GraphQL queries are optimized, the TypeScript types for the API are updated to reflect the changes that happened to the GraphQL schema. This process is also transparent.
