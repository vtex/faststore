# Overriding a native component

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This documentation is currently under development.
</Callout>

In this guide, you will learn how to override a native component to use a custom component.

The `@faststore/core` package provides a set of native sections. These native sections are made up of various components, each offering distinct functionalities. You can customize specific components within a native section or replace them entirely with alternative options that better align with your desired functionality or appearance. For example, you may want to modify the behavior of the `Price` component from the [TODO] section to meet your business needs.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **By overriding a component, you lose all the integration developed on
  [@faststore/core](docs/getting-started/project-structure#faststorecore) for
  that component.** We highly recommend that you pass additional props and use
  our [theming tools](/docs/customizing) to achieve the desired behavior without
  compromising the existing integration implemented in `@faststore/core`. You
  can find the available props for each component on the [Components
  UI](https://evergreen.faststore.dev/components).

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you have a functioning FastStore project.

Also, consider the following:

- **This feature is experimental**: The feature may not function as expected.

- **Some sections contain multiple instances of the same component**: When overriding a component or passing additional props to it, consider that all instances will be affected by this change.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Setting up the `overrides` folder

1. Choose the native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-available-native-sections).
2. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
3. Navigate to `src/components/overrides` and create a new file named after the chosen native section. For example, if you chose the `ProductDetails` section for customization, create a new file named `ProductDetails.tsx` under the `src/components/overrides` directory.

4. Copy and paste the following code snippet into the file:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails'

const overrides: SectionOverride[SECTION] = { name: SECTION, components: {} }

export default overrides
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Change the value of the `SECTION` variable to the name of the section you want
  to override. In the given example, we set the `SECTION` variable to
  `ProductDetails` to override this specific section.
</Callout>

4. Save your changes.

### Step 2 - Overriding the component

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components for each native section](/docs/reference-guides/list-of-overridable-components-for-each-native-section). In this example, we are overriding the `Price` component.
2. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
3. Inside the `components` folder, add a new file with the name of the component you wish to override.

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from '@faststore/core/src/typings/overrides'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails'

const overrides: SectionOverride[SECTION] = {
  name: SECTION,
  components: {
    Price: {},
  },
}

export default overrides
```
