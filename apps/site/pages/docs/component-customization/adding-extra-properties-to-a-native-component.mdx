In this guide you'll learn how to customize a native component by adding extra props to it.  Adding extra props allows you to customize a component's behavior without modifying the integration built for the native component. 
This approach is particularly useful when you want to change specific aspects of a native component while preserving its integration. 

For example, if you want to change the value set in the Price component in a PDP, you can add a new value for the component though its props.

## Before you start

**Choose a native section and the component you want to customize.**

All component customizations in FastStore are done within a section, so choose the native section and component you wish to add extra properties to.
Check out the available native sections and its components in the [List of available native sections](/tbd).

For this guide, we'll use the [Price component](/components/atoms/price) as an example. Here's how the initial component looks like with the value prop set as `950.04`:

## Step by step

1. Create a `components` folder in the `src` directory.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `Price.tsx` and add the following code:

```tsx
    import React, { FunctionComponent } from "react";
    import { Price as UIPrice, PriceProps } from "@faststore/ui";

    export function Price(props: PriceProps) {
        return <UIPrice {...props} value={800}></UIPrice>;
    };

```
The code above imports the necessary components and props from the @faststore/ui package. It creates a *Custom Price* component that sets the `value` prop to `800`.

3. Create an `overrides` folder inside the `components` folder.
4. Inside the `overrides` folder, create a file named `ProductDetails.tsx`
5. Open the `ProductDetails.tsx` file and add the following code:

```tsx
import { Price as CustomPrice } from "../Price";
import { SectionOverride } from "./types";

const SECTION = "ProductDetails" as const;

const overrides: SectionOverride[typeof SECTION] = {
    components: {
        Price: { Component: CustomPrice },
    },
};

export default overrides;

```

This code imports the *Custom Price* component and overrides the native Price component in the `ProductDetails` section.

6. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the provided localhost URL in your browser to see the updated Price component with the new `value`prop set to `800`:

 The `value` props is only changed in the `ProductDetails` section.
