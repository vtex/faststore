# Overriding Native Section Components

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Overriding a component leads you to miss out on performance updates and bug
  fixes provided by VTEX for that component. We highly recommend you to pass
  additional prop and using our theming tools to achieve the desired behavior
  without missing out on updates and bug fixes from VTEX. Check out the
  available props for each component on [Components
  UI](https://evergreen.faststore.dev/components).

**Native sections** are made up of different components that can be customized or overridden to improve their functionality or appearance in the storefront.
For example, you might want to change the behavior of a Price component to meet your business needs.
In this guide, you'll learn how to customize native section components by overriding them or adding extra props.

  The `@faststore/core` package provides default native sections.

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you have a functioning Evergreen store.

Also, take in to consideration the following:

- **This feature is experimental**: The feature may not function as expected.

- **Some sections contain multiple instances of the same component**:  When overriding a component or passing additional props to it, consider that all instances will be affected by this.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Choosing a Native Section

1. Choose the native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](./tbd-link).
2. In your store repository, navigate to `src/components/overrides` and create a new file named after the native section.
   For example, if you chose the `ProductDetails` section for customization, create a new file named `ProductDetails.tsx` under the `src/components/overrides` directory.

3. Copy and paste the following boilerplate on the file:

```tsx
const SECTION = 'ProductDetails'

const overrides: SectionOverride[SECTION] = { name: SECTION, components: {} }

export default overrides
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Change the value of the `SECTION` variable to the name of the section you want
  to override. In this case, we used the `ProductDetails` example.
</Callout>

### Step 2 - Choosing a component to override

1. Choose a component to override from the [list of overridable components for each native section](/tbd-link). In this example, we are overriding the `Price` component.

2. Add an object with the name of the component you wish to override to the `components` property inside the `overrides` object.

```tsx
const SECTION = 'ProductDetails'

const overrides: SectionOverride[SECTION] = {
  name: SECTION,
  components: {
    Price: {},
  },
}

export default overrides
```

### Step 3 - Overriding or Passing additional props to a component

In this step, you will learn how to enhance the functionality or appearance of a component by overriding or passing additional props to it.



#### Overrinding the Component

1. Inside the `Price` object, add a property called `Component`. This property value should be defined as a React component created by you, that will be used to replace every instance of the `Price` component inside the `ProductDetails` section.

```tsx
import CustomPrice from 'src/components/custom/CustomPrice'

const SECTION = 'ProductDetails'

const overrides: SectionOverride[SECTION] = {
  name: SECTION,
  components: {
    Price: {
      Component: CustomPrice,
    },
  },
}

export default overrides
```

2. Once you've finished the previous step, you should be able to see your `CustomPrice` component replacing the native `Price` component inside every `ProductDetails` section in your store.

#### Passing Additional Props to the Component

1. Inside the `Price` object, add a property called `props`. In addition to the default props this component receives from the section it is contained, every property defined inside the props object will also be passed to it. If a prop you passed has the same name as an already existing prop being received by the component, yours will override the default definition.

```tsx
const SECTION = 'ProductDetails'

const overrides: SectionOverride[SECTION] = {
  name: SECTION,
  components: {
    Price: {
      props: {
        variation: 'listing',
      },
    },
  },
}

export default overrides
```

2. Once you've finished the previous step, you should be able to see the new behavior present wherever the `ProductDetails` is present.
