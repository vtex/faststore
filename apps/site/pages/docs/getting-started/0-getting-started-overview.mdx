In this Getting Started track, you'll build and deploy a FastStore Storefront at the domain `https://<account-name>.vtex.app/`.

By the end of this track, you'll have a fully functional store using FastStore, seamlessly integrated with VTEX native solutions like [Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0).
Here's an example of the final result: [Starter Store](https://starter.vtex.app).

## Before you start

**1. Ensure that you have installed the VTEX IO CLI on your machine.** 

For more information, please refer to [this guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference).



**2. To develop a storefront in FastStore, your account edition must be `vtex.edition-store@5.x`.**

 The `5.x` major ensures that the [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search) app is installed in your account. After that, you need to activate the app's synchronization in the VTEX Admin.  

If you are using a major above `5.x`, [open a ticket with VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and specify that you require your store's Edition app to be `vtex.edition-store@5.x` for FastStore development.

> ℹ️ To check your account edition use the VTEX IO CLI, log in to the VTEX store account by running `vtex login {account-name}` in the terminal. After, run `vtex edition get` to display the Edition App version installed on the current account.


**3. The FastStore Onboarding app must be installed in your store account.** 

The app is where you start your FastStore project, and to request the installation of the app, [open a ticket with the VTEX support team](https://help.vtex.com/support).
