In this Getting Started track, you will build and deploy a FastStore storefront at the domain `https://{accountName}.vtex.app/`.

By the end of this track, you'll have a fully functional store using FastStore, seamlessly integrated with VTEX native solutions like [Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0).
Here's an example of the final result: [Starter Store](https://starter.vtex.app).

## Before you start

**1. Install the VTEX IO CLI on your machine.** 

For more information, please refer to [this guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference).

**2. Verify the compatibility of your store's Edition App.**

To develop a storefront in FastStore, your account [Edition](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) must be `vtex.edition-store@5.x`. If you are using a different major version, please [open a ticket with VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and request the installation of the Edition app `vtex.edition-store@5.x`.

> ℹ️ To check which Edition App version is intalled in your account, open the terminal and use the VTEX IO CLI. Log in to your account by running `vtex login {accountName}` and run `vtex edition get` to see the Edition App version installed on the current account.

**3. Run the Intelligent Search integration process.**

[TODO]

**4. Request the installation of the FastStore Onboarding app.** 

The FastStore Onboarding app is where you start your FastStore project.
