# Getting started

</header>

In this Getting Started track, you will build and deploy a FastStore storefront at the domain `https://{accountName}.vtex.app/`.

By the end of this track, you'll have a fully functional store using FastStore, seamlessly integrated with VTEX native solutions like [Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0).
Here's an example of the final result: [Starter Store](https://starter.vtex.app).

## Before you start

To develop a storefront in FastStore, your account [Edition](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) must be `vtex.edition-store@5.x`.

  terminal and use the VTEX IO CLI. Log in to your account by running `vtex
  login {accountName}` and run `vtex edition get` to see the Edition App version
  installed on the current account.
