# FastStore CLI

</header>

The FastStore Command Line Interface (CLI) is the main pre-configured tool for initializing, building and developing FastStore projects.

Also the CLI is the responsible on keeping the stores up-to-date with the [`@faststore/core`](/docs/getting-started/3-project-structure#faststorecore) package and enables the cloud platform to understand the FastStore project.

## Runnig FastStore CLI on the project

The CLI is a dependency in the `package.json` file of the FastStore project, so once you run `yarn install` during the [set up of the project](/docs/getting-started/2-setting-up-the-project) you can start using it on the project.

### Commands

#### `dev`

Starts the project in the development environment and usally servers it at `http://localhost:3000`. It allows you to make changes to the project and see the results in real-time locally on your machine without affecting the production environment.

```bash
  yarn dev
```

#### `build`

Generates a store in the production environment by compiling the project and optimizing it for production usage.

```bash
  yarn build
```

#### `start`

Executes a Next.js project in the root directory and usally servers it at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
  yarn start
```
