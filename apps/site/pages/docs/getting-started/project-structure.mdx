In the previous guide of this track, you started your first FastStore store, learned how to run a local server and make your first change in the storefront. Now it's time to understand how our project is structured.

By understanding the structure of a FastStore project, you better navigate the codebase and make customizations to fit your specific needs.

Let's start taking a look at the structure that represents the source code of a FastStore project:
  
  ```
  /
  |-- /.github
  |-- /node_modules
  |-- /src
      |-- /themes
          |-- custom-theme.scss
  |-- .gitignore
  |-- cypress.json
  |-- faststore.config.js
  |-- next-env.d.ts
  |-- package.json
  |-- README.md
  |-- tsconfig.json
  |-- vercel.json
  |-- vtex.env
  |-- yarn.lock

  ```
