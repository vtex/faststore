# Dashboard

</header>

After [successfully deploying and creating the repository and live preview of your store](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/onboarding#repository-and-live-store-created), 
you can access the Dashboard page for detailed information about your store deploys. 
The Dashboard displays the current status of your store, including its domains, deployed versions, store preview, and commits.

On the Dashboard page, you will find two main views: Overview and Deploys. For more information about each view, continue reading the next sections.

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                           |

| **Deployment**        | Opens the deployed version of the store in a new tab.                                                                                 |
| **Domain**            | Opens the URL of your store's domain, which is the same as the preview.                                                               |
| **Last commit**       | Displays the most recent commit to your store's repository, including the date, month, year, and the GitHub user who made the commit. |
| **Status**            | Displays the status of the deployment.                                                                                                |

The **Status** field can have one of the following values: 
- `Success`: The deployment was successful. If you want to check the commit associated with it, go to the **Deploys** tab.

- `Error`: There was an error in the pipeline that caused the deployment to fail, but the build can still be successful. 
To understand what happened, go to the **Deploys** tab, check the last commit, and open the repository for further investigation.

## Deploys

The **Deploys** view provides a summary of each deployment made in your store's repository.
