# Dashboard

</header>

After [successfully deploying and creating the repository and live preview of your store](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/onboarding#repository-and-live-store-created), 
you can access the Dashboard page for detailed information about your store deploys. 
The Dashboard displays the current status of your store, including its domains, deployed versions, store preview, and commits.

![dashboard-overview](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-overview___56923825cfdcfc7018cbfe3a9aa726ee.gif)

On the Dashboard page, you will find two main views: Overview and Deploys. For more information about each view, continue reading the next sections.

## Overview

The **Overview** section provides information about the production deployment of your store.

| **Preview FastStore** | Opens a preview of your store in a new tab.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Deployment**        | Opens the deployed version of the store in a new tab.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Domain**            | Opens the URL of your store's domain, which is the same as the preview.                                                                                                                              |
| **Last commit**       | Displays the most recent commit to your store's repository, including the date, month, year, and the GitHub user who made the commit.                                                                |
| **Status**            | Displays the status of the deployment. For more information on the status values, refer to [Status available values](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/dashboard#status-available-values). |

### Status available values

The **Status** field can have one of the following values: 
- `Success`: The deployment was successful. If you want to check the commit associated with it, go to the **Deploys** tab.

- `Error`: An error in the pipeline caused the deploy to fail. To identify the specific step where the error occurred, access the **Deploys** tab and check the last commit. 
Then, access your store repository and verify the pipeline related to that commit. Note that a deploy can fail even if the build process is successful. 
In this case, even though the code compiled correctly, the deploy may have failed in a specific step of the pipeline.

## Deploys

The **Deploys** section provides a summary of each deployment made in your store's repository.

### Quality checks available values

The **Quality checks** field can have one of the following values:

- `Success`: All checks have passed.

- `Skipped`: In the CI process, specific checks were not performed for certain commits. 
This often occurs when the commit being tested was never the HEAD commit of the main branch, saving time and resources without compromising code quality.

- `Failed`: For more information on the `Failed` status, go to the repository and check what failed in the commit.
