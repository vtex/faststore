This document provides an overview of the FastStore Onboarding app, a specialized tool designed to simplify the process of setting up a store. The app allows you to focus on building your storefront without the hassle of complex configurations.

## Before you start

### 1. Request the app's installation

Please open a ticket with the [VTEX support team](https://help.vtex.com/support) to request the installation of the FastStore Onboarding app.


### 2. Create your store Catalog

Create a Catalog for populating and testing your store with features like product listing pages, search functionality, product detail pages, and checkout. Without a Catalog, testing would be incomplete, and developing without it can cause data integration issues, delays, and extra retrofitting effort.

For more information on how to create a Catlog, refer to the [Catalog documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3rA2tTpIoEXdv2nzC27zxR).
