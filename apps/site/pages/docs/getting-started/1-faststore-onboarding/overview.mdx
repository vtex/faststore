# FastStore Onboarding app

</header>

The FastStore Onboarding app simplifies the store setup process, allowing you to focus on building your storefront without dealing with complex configurations. With the app,
you can easily configure essential store settings, including Catalog, CMS integration, and SEO tags.

Once the setup is complete, the app automatically deploys your FastStore project. 
By the end, you'll have a GitHub repository with your project and the initial version of your store website.

## Before you start

### 1. Request the app's installation

Please open a ticket with the [VTEX support team](https://help.vtex.com/support) to request the installation of the FastStore Onboarding app.


### 2. Create your store Catalog

Create a Catalog for populating and testing your store with features like product listing pages, search functionality, product detail pages, and checkout. Without a Catalog, testing would be incomplete, and developing without it can cause data integration issues, delays, and extra retrofitting effort.

For more information on how to create a Catlog, refer to the [Catalog documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/3rA2tTpIoEXdv2nzC27zxR).
