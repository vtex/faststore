Starting a new FastStore project

Now that you have an [overview of the app](/docs/getting-started/faststore-onboarding/overview), let's start the project.

### Step 1: Setup & Create Project

1. Click on `Start Project`.
2. In the **Setup & Create Project** page, ensure to define the basic configuration for your store:

**CMS Integration**

| Field             | Description     | 
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| **VTEX Headless CMS** | The option available to use a CMS in a FastStore project is [VTEX Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/0), VTEX's Content Management solution. |



**SEO Tags**

| Field           | Description     | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| **Title Tag**       | Type a keyword-optimized title for your store. For example: `Buy Online with the Best Game Store - GameStore`. In this example, we used the length limit of around 50-60 characters to ensure it is fully displayed in search results without being truncated. |
| **Description Tag** | Type a short description about your store, for example `Shop online at GameStore, the best game store for PC, Xbox, PS4 and Headphones. Explore our wide selection and buy your favorite games today!` |
| **Title Template**  | Type  a page title that helps search engines and users better understand the content of your store. For example `The best game store - GameStore`. |
| **Site Author**     | Type the name of the agency or person responsible for the storefront. |


**Github Acesss**

| Field                | Description     | 
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| **Repository owner** | Enter the GitHub username of the person who will be the owner of the FastStore repository. Once the repository is created, the owner will be granted access. |




**Google Tag Manager**

| Field                | Description     | 
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| **GTM ID** | Enter your store's Google Tag Manager ID (GTM ID) associated with a GTM container that manages and organizes your store's tags. |



**Catalog**

| Field                | Description     | 
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| **Catalog** | Define which catalog your store needs to be linked with. |


After setting up the basic configuration for your store and reviewing it, click on Create to proceed to the next page, Deploy Summary.

### Step 2: Deploy Summary

Once you have completed the setup for your store, the deploy process will start.
This process includes creating a repository and creating a live store. Once the process is finished, you will have one of the following scenarios:

#### Repository and Live Store created

![success-scenario](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/fs-deploy-summary___fff7675f0520efb8e7fbf51307af69f8.png)

In this scenario, both the repository and the live preview of the store were successfully created. You now have the following options:

| Option                    | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your Repository**       | Access the store's Github repository and start setting up and customizing your store according to your brand. |
| **Documentation**         | Access the FastStore Portal Documentation.                                                                    |
| **Storybook Components**  | Check out the native features and components.                                                                 |
| **Customization**         | Access the documentation on how to customize your store.                                                      |
| **View Dashboard**        | Provides an overview of the store's current status, including deployed versions, the current domain, store preview, and settings. You can use this feature to retry a failed deploy or delete the project if needed. For more detailed information, please refer to the [Dashboard](/docs/getting-started/1-faststore-onboarding/dashboard) guide. |

Now that your store is up and running, let's set up the development environment by following the step-by-step instructions in [Setting up the Project](/docs/getting-started/settingup-project).

#### Repository Creation Failed

![failed-scenario](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/fs-deploy-error___82b3aa8e15a88bbe4fb8f134eba79fca.png)

In this scenario, the repository was not created, and as a result, the creation of the live preview also failed. Click on `Retry` to initiate the deploy process again.
Once the issue is resolved, you will see the [Repository and Live Store created](#repository-and-live-store-created) scenario.
