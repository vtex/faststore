Now that your store is up and running, let's set up the development environment by following the step-by-step instructions in [Setting up the Project](/docs/getting-started/2-setting-up-the-project).

#### Repository creation failed

![failed-scenario](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/fs-deploy-error___82b3aa8e15a88bbe4fb8f134eba79fca.png)

In this scenario, the repository creation was unsuccessful, resulting in the failure to generate the live store preview. Click `Retry` to redeploy the process. Once the issue is resolved, you will see the [Repository and Live Store created](#repository-and-live-store-created) scenario.
