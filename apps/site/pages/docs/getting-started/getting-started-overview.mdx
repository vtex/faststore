In this Getting Started track, you'll build and deploy a FastStore Storefront at the domain `https://<account-name>.vtex.app/`.

By the end of this track, you'll have a fully functional store using FastStore, seamlessly integrated with VTEX native solutions like [Headless CMS](/tbd), [Catalog](/tbd), and [Checkout](/tbd).
Here's an example of the final result: [Starter Store](https://starter.vtex.app).

**1. [FastStore Onboarding](/tbd)** 

Start your project with the FastStore Onboarding app. It streamlines the process by setting up the essential store configurations, creating a Github repository for your store, and providing a live demo preview of your store.

**2. [Setting Up the Project](/tbd)**

**3. [Understanding the Project Structure](/tbd)**

**4. [Next Steps](/tbd)**
