### Install the VTEX IO CLI on your machine

For more information, please refer to [this guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference).

### Enable the VTEX Intelligent Search app in your account

The [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search) app enhances the user experience by providing accurate and personalized search results throughout the shopping journey. 
Before developing a storefront in FastStore, you need to enable the app on your account. 

To enable the app, begin by checking the version of your [Edition Store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) account. Based on the account version, follow the instructions below.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  To check which Edition App version is installed in your account, open the terminal and use the VTEX IO CLI. Log in to your account by running `vtex login {accountName}` and run `vtex edition get` to see the Edition App version installed on the current account.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Accounts in the vtex.edition-store@5.x', 'Accounts using an edition version below 5.x', 'Accounts that want to migrate to the 5.x.']}>
  <Tab>
    If your account is using the `vtex.edition-store@5.x` major, the VTEX Intelligent Search app is already included, and you need to integrate the app via VTEX Admin. 
    <br></br>
    To integrate the VTEX Intelligent Search, go to the VTEX Admin and access **Store Settings > Intelligent Search > Integrations** and click on `START INTEGRATION`. 
  </Tab>
    
  <Tab>
        
    If the VTEX Intelligent Search app is not installed in your account, make sure to install it before continuing:


    1. In the VTEX IO CLI, log in to your VTEX account by running `vtex login {accountName}`. *Remember to replace the value between brackets with your account name.*

    2. Run the following for Intelligent Search:

    ```bash
    vtex install vtex.search-resolver@1.x vtex.admin-search@1.x
    ```
    After successfully installing the app, integrate it by accessing the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Intelligent Search > Integrations** and click on `START INTEGRATION`. 
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    If you are using a different major version and want to migrate, please [open a ticket with VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and request the installation of the Edition app `vtex.edition-store@5.x`.
