### Enable the VTEX Intelligent Search app in your account

The [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search) app enhances the user experience by providing accurate and personalized search results throughout the shopping journey. 
Before developing a storefront in FastStore, you need to enable the app on your account.

To enable the app, begin by checking the version of your [Edition Store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) account. 

Based on the edition version, follow the instructions below.
