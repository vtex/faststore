# Theming

Themes are CSS stylesheets consisting of configurable design tokens. You can create your own theme by setting up global and local tokens as desired.

A Theme is what enables you to change the look and feel of a FastStore project. It is what differentiates one UI from another and where the store branding lives. In practice, Themes are CSS stylesheets consisting of configurable design tokens.


- **Global tokens** - structural styles responsible for establishing the behavior (e.g., showing/hiding a dropdown menu) and design pattern of a component.

- **Local tokens** - a set of configurable design tokens responsible for defining the appearance of graphical elements, such as typography, type scale, colors, borders, spacing, and more.

By default, every FastStore project comes with the [Brandless theme](/docs/theming-overview#brandless-and-theming-structure). However, you have the option to use one of the [available themes](#available-themes) or [create a custom theme](#creating-a-custom-theme).


In this guide, you will have an overview of the strucure and architecture of Themes and Design tokens.

## Brandless and theming structure

The Brandless theming structure consists of two important parts: **Structural Styles** and **Theme**.

**Structural Styles** provide the basic design patterns for different uses. They also handle essential interactions like showing/hiding dropdown menus or activating toggles.

The **Theme layer** is where the branding comes in. 
It's what makes each UI unique. Design elements like typography, colors, images, borders, and spacing are controlled through design tokens and you can adjust these tokens to create a distinct look and feel.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', marginTop: '12px' }}>
<img

  style={{ width: '90%', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
</div>

You can also customize or override the styles set in the Structural Styles or Theme layers for even more flexibility. 
Alternatively, you have the option to start from scratch and create your own styles without using any pre-existing FastStore CSS.

By understanding and using the Structural Styles and Theme layers, you can create visually appealing and unique user interfaces while maintaining control and flexibility.

## Theming architecture

Let's break down the theming architecture from the bottom up. We start with components, which are fully-featured UI blocks that are part of a larger system. 
Each component has its own CSS that determines its overall look and arrangement. These CSS stylesheets are called Templates.

The Templates rely on local variables known as design tokens, which define the visual properties of the component. These design tokens are scoped and specific to each component. They play a crucial role in creating the final appearance of the component.

On a higher level, these local design tokens are connected to global tokens, forming the Theme. The global tokens are responsible for setting the overall visual style of the entire system.

Here's an image that illustrates the Theming Architecture:

## Design tokens naming scheme

### Scoped Tokens (components)

All components' design tokens must follow a strict scheme to achieve predictability and cohesiveness. The tokens parts must tell:

- **Namespacing**: Where this token is coming from (is it a global or a component's local part);
- **Component**: Their semantic meaning;
- **Type**: What property type it affects;
- **Category** Which category of this type is going to be affected;
- **State**: Their interactive state.

If needed, we can use other additional incrementation to the token's name, such as:

- **Hierarchy**: Define its tier;
- **Nested Element**: To sytle elements contained inside the component;
- **Variant**: What differentiate it from the default;
- **Situation**: When they should be used;

### Theme (or global design tokens)

Global design tokens are parameters that affect all UI look 'n' feel. They are the main configuration file of a Theme. It's constituted of three main groups:

1. Branding Core
2. UI Essentials
3. Refinements
