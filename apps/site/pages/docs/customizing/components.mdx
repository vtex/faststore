# Customizing a component

Customize the styling of a component by using design tokens that align with your store's branding.

</header>

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to customize the style of a FastStore component using its local tokens. For the sake of this tutorial, We will use the `Listing` variant from the [Price Component](/components/atoms/price).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Bear mind that when changing the style of a component you can also use [Global tokens](/docs/global-tokens/overview) or styling from scratch using your preferred styling tool. However, changing the value of a global token may affect different parts of your store's interface.

1. In the `soft-blue.scss` file, add the `data-fs-price` and  `data-fs-price-variant` data attributes with the `Listing` value:

```scss
  ...
  [data-fs-logo] {
    --fs-logo-width: 8rem;
  }

  [data-fs-price] [data-fs-price-variant="listing"] {
  }

```

2. Now, change the color of the `Listing` variant using its [local token](/components/atoms/price#design-tokens). For this tutorial, we will use the shade of red `#cb4242`:

```scss
  }

  [data-fs-price][data-fs-price-variant="listing"] {
      --fs-price-listing-color: #cb4242;
  }

```

3. Save your changes and check your browser to see the new color of your listing price. You may need to refresh the page.
