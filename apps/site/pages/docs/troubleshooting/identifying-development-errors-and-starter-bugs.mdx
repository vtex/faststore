# Identifying development errors and Starter bugs

</header>

While developing with FastStore, you may run into errors. Some of these may require fixes in FastStore libraries, while others may require adjusting your code.

Hence, before proceeding with any advanced troubleshooting, we recommend that you first check if you are facing a bug from FastStore/WebOps or a mistake on your side.

If the problem persists with the starter, we recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/issues/new/choose) and reporting the problem. However, if the error only occurs in your own project, please refer to the [Tracing the error source](/docs/troubleshooting/tracing-the-error-source) guide to continue debugging your store.
