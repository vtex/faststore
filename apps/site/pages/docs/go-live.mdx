**FastStore** is a solution to develop high-performance frontends for ecommerce websites. However, there are other core features that make up a complete digital commerce experience. At **VTEX**, some of these core features are:

- **Checkout** - receives the shopper's information necessary to process an order.
- **OrderPlaced** - displays a successful message right after the checkout process is completed.
- **Login** - handles user login in a store.
- **MyAccount** - allows customers to manage their orders and personal data (e.g., profile info, password, addresses, and credit cards) on a single page.
- **VTEX Intelligent Search** - 

Therefore, to provide shoppers with a full checkout and post-purchase experience, you, as a developer, must guarantee the integration between your FastStore project and VTEX solutions before going live.

To ensure that you have set up all configurations for your store to run smoothly.
copy this [store configuration checklist](/tbd) and check if you have configured each item according to your desired operation.
 

> ⚠️ The checklist above lists the basic features and configurations required to run a VTEX store. It is your team's responsibility to determine which features to implement in your store and how to configure them to create the desired store experience. Therefore, this list may only cover some of the features your store uses, and you must check all aspects of your store's operation, even if they are not on the suggested list. Ainda assim é importante que verifique todos os aspectos do funcionamento da sua loja, mesmo que não estejam na lista sugerida.
