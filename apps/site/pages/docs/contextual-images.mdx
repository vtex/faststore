# Contextual Images

</header>

Sometimes store owners want images to appear only in specific contexts, such as a product image that should appear only on the SKU Selector, not on the gallery.

## How to use contextual images

### 1. Use Labels on VTEX Catalog

On VTEX's catalog, you should set the Label field of the product image to a context name. The only labels with special meaning are `generic` and `skuvariation`. If you label an image with `generic` you won't be able to filter for that individual label, you will always end up with the full set of images. 

In this example we're going to [add the `gallery` label](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/catalog-101--5AF0XfnjfWeopIFBgs3LIQ/17PxekVPmVYI4c3OCQ0ddJ#adding-an-image-to-the-sku) to images that we want to display on the PDP's Image Gallery.

### 2. Query for the correct images on their context

Add fragments to both `ServerProductQuery` and `ClientProductQuery`:

```js filename="src/fragments/ServerProduct" copy 
import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'
 
export const fragment = gql`
  fragment ServerProduct on Query {
    product(locator: $locator) {
      galleryImages: image(context: "gallery", limit: 3) {
        url
        alternateName
      }
    }
  }
`
```

```js filename="src/fragments/ClientProduct" copy 
import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'
 
export const fragment = gql`
  fragment ClientProduct on Query {
    product(locator: $locator) {
      galleryImages: image(context: "gallery", limit: 3) {
        url
        alternateName
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Note that we are only selecting three images by passing the `limit: 3` argument. If we omit this argument, all images labeled `gallery` will be returned. For backward compatibility, all the images are returned whenever a context is not found as a Label on a Product's images.

### 3. Override the ImageGallery

Create the `src/components/overrides/ProductDetails.tsx` file and add the following content to it:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from "@faststore/core";

import { usePDP } from "@faststore/core";
import { Image_unstable as Image } from "@faststore/core/experimental";

import { ImageGallery, ImageGalleryViewer } from "@faststore/ui";
import { useState } from "react";

const SECTION = "ProductDetails" as const;

const ImageComponent = ({ url, alternateName }: {url: string, alternateName?: string}) => {
  return <Image src={url} alt={alternateName} width={68} height={68}/>
}

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    __experimentalImageGallery: {
      Component: () => {
        // The ServerProductQuery and ClientProductQuery fragments are accessed via the usePDP Hook.
        const { data } = usePDP();
        const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState<number>(0);

        // Instead of using the images being passed to the ImageGallery Component, we are using the galleryImages we specifically asked for.  
        const currentImage = data.product.galleryImages[selectedIndex];

        return (
          <ImageGallery
            images={data.product.galleryImages}
            ImageComponent={ImageComponent}
            selectedImageIdx={selectedIndex}
            setSelectedImageIdx={setSelectedIndex}
            data-fs-product-details-gallery="true"
          >
            <ImageGalleryViewer>
              <Image
                sizes="(max-width: 360px) 50vw, (max-width: 768px) 90vw, 50vw"
                width={691}
                height={691 * (3 / 4)}
                loading="eager"
                src={currentImage.url}
                alt={currentImage.alternateName}
              />
            </ImageGalleryViewer>
          </ImageGallery>
        );
      },
    },
  },
};

export { override };
```

### 4. Selecting an image for the SKU Selector

As mentioned above, the FastStore API defines a special name for images that are supposed to appear on the SKU Selector. The first image labeled `skuvariation` on the Catalog will automatically appear on the SKU Selector. If no image has the `skuvariation` label, the first image of the SKU will be displayed.

## Trade-offs

If you need an image to appear in different contexts (SKU Selector and Product Gallery) you should upload it twice and set different labels for each of the images.
