# Improvements to API extensions - v3.0.0

In this guide, learn how to migrate your store version to v3.0.0 to leverage the latest improvements in the API extension.

Version 3.0.0 and above, introduces the following enhancements to API extension users:

- Deprecation of the `@faststore/graphql-utils` package in favor of the [`client-preset`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/presets/preset-client) plugin.

- Refinement `gql` helper usage for a smoother and more efficient GraphQL query handling.

- Enhancement security measures to a more secure method for invoking queries and mutations to safeguard your store's data.

- Optimization call processes for queries or mutations defined within `@faststore/core`.

The `@faststore/graphql-utils` has been replaced by open-source solutions maintained by the community that are now re-exported from `@faststore/core`. There are minor breaking changes on how developers should write GraphQL definitions and invoke queries and mutations, which were introduced in version 3.0.0.

## Before you begin

Make sure your store version is updated to v3.0.0 or above. If it’s not updated follow the instructions below:

1. Open your store code and navigate to the `package.json` file.

2. In `dependencies` > `@faststore/core`, change the version to the following:

```json
"@faststore/core": "^3.0.0",
```

3. Open the terminal and run `yarn` to update the version.

## Updating the `gql` helper usage

The `gql` helper serves as a function to define GraphQL operations such as queries, mutations, or fragments within the store code. Before, the function was imported directly from the `@faststore/graphql-utils` which was not recommended. See the example below:

```tsx filename="src/fragments/ClientProduct.tsx"
import { gql } from '@faststore/graphql-utils'

export const fragment = gql`
  fragment ClientProduct on Query {
    product(locator: $locator) {
      id: productID
      breadcrumbList {
        itemListElement {
          item
          name
          position
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Now with the v3.0.0, you should import the `gql` helper from `@faststore/core/api`and be called as a function - with the argument between parenthesis. This also applies to query and mutation definitions inside the components. For example:

```tsx filename="src/fragments/ClientProduct.tsx" {1}
import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'

export const fragment = gql(`
  fragment ClientProduct on Query {
    product(locator: $locator) {
      id: productID
      breadcrumbList {
        itemListElement {
          item
          name
          position
        }
      }
    }
  }
`)
```

## Using `useQuery` hook to call queries and mutations

Previously, it was possible to invoke queries and mutations by using their names - such as `MyCustomQuery` by providing it to the `useQuery` hook. For example:

```tsx
import { useQuery_unstable as useQuery } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

const query = gql(`
  query MyCustomQuery {
    customQuery() {
      data
    }
  }
`)

// The useQuery call will now throw an error
function CustomComponent() {
  // ...
  const result = useQuery(`MyCustomQuery`, variables)
  // ...
}
```

With v3.0.0, queries and mutations are now only invoked using more secure hashes, which are randomly generated and do to that you must pass the query or mutation object - result of the `gql` call - to `useQuery` directly. For example:

```tsx
import { gql } from '@faststore/core/api'
import { useQuery_unstable as useQuery } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

const query = gql(`
  query MyCustomQuery {
    customQuery() {
      data
    }
  }
`)

// useQuery apropriately calls MyCustomQuery
function CustomComponent() {
  // ...
  const result = useQuery(query, variables)
  // ...
}
```

### Calling queries or mutations defined by `@faststore/core`

A custom component can call a query or mutation defined by `@faststore/core`, such as `ClientManyProductsQuery`. In these cases, you replace the `useQuery` hook call with a call to the specific hook for that query.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The availability of such hooks is limited.
</Callout>
```tsx
import { useClientManyProducts_unstable as useClientManyProducts } from '@faststore/core/experimental'

// ClientManyProductsQuery will be called with the variables passed by CustomComponent
function CustomComponent() {
// ...
const result = useClientManyProducts(variables)
// ...
}
