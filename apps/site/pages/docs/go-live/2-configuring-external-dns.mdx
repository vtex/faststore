# Part 2: Configuring external DNS for a custom domain

</header>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
This documentation is currently under development.
</Callout>

In this guide, you will learn how to configure external domains for your **FastStore + VTEX** website. The process involves the following steps:

 - Set up your external DNS provider to point your custom domain to your VTEX website. Custom domains can be purchased from any **domain registration platform**.
 - Configure your custom domains in **VTEX Account Settings**.
 - Associate your custom domains with your **FastStore** project.

Besides making your FastStore website accessible via a custom domain, the **VTEX Checkout** will also be operational as soon as you complete this guide. You'll then be ready to continue configuring other VTEX solutions, such as **Order Placed**, **Login**, and **My Account**.

---

## Before you start

- [Set up your VTEX account.](/docs/go-live/1-setting-up-vtex-account-for-faststore)
- Develop your FastStore project with **Next.js** by following the [Getting Started track](/docs/getting-started-overview).
- Deploy your FastStore project.
- Buy the desired domain.
- [Redirect the **root domain** to the `www` subdomain.](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configuring-access-without-www--tutorials_4278#root-domain-redirect-without-www)

## Step by step

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you still need to configure other VTEX solutions, please **use a fictitious domain name** while taking the following steps. Once you have set up all the desired integrations, repeat this guide using your final domain to make your website publicly available to end-users.
</Callout>


### Step 1 - Creating DNS records

1. Access your domain provider's website.
2. Create a **CNAME** DNS record for your `www` domain (e.g., `www.mystore.com`) that points to `www.{rootDomain}.com.cdn.vtex.com` (e.g., `www.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com`). _Check the documentation of your domain provider for more information._
3. Now, create a **CNAME** record for the `secure` subdomain (e.g., `secure.mystore.com`) that points to `secure.{rootDomain}.cdn.vtex.com` (e.g., `secure.mystore.com.cdn.vtex.com`). This subdomain will be used by the **Checkout**, **Order Placed**, **Login**, and **My Account** pages.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Please note that the configured addresses may not be immediately available to everyone due to DNS propagation, which can take 24-48 hours to complete.
</Callout>


### Step 2 - Configuring domains in VTEX Account Settings

Now, you must set up your VTEX account to use the DNS records created in the previous step. To proceed, make sure your [store is active and in production](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/go-live-your-store--4Ns5FxIiksmjsdX2yOTduM/7wFsbWgN4rnZsbjhv8IItX#putting-your-account-into-production).

1. In the VTEX Admin, click on your profile avatar, which can be identified by the first letter of your email address.
2. Access **Account Settings > Account**.
3. Go to the **Stores** tab and in the **Hosts** table, click the *kebab* menu (three vertical dots) and choose **Edit**.
4. In the **Hosts** field, enter your main domain (e.g., `mystore.com`) to the list.
5. Click `Add`.
6. Add the `secure` subdomain (e.g., `secure.mystore.com`) to the list.
   ![Host configuration](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/hostsConfig___cad00ec89023cd77c34f77898cda1b3e.png)
7. Click the **Save** button.

### Step 3 - Associating your custom domain with your FastStore project

Back to your FastStore project, you must also configure your project to point to the right addresses and domains.

1. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Open the `faststore.config.js` file.
3. Update the `storeUrl`, `secureSubdomain`, `checkoutUrl`, `loginUrl`, and `accountUrl` properties as in the following:

   - **`storeUrl`**: `https://{rootDomain}`
   - **`secureSubdomain`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}`
   - **`checkoutUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}/checkout`
   - **`loginUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}/api/io/login`
   - **`accountUrl`**: `https://{subdomain}.{rootDomain}/api/io/account`

Take the following example of how this code block would look after configuring a store with the `www.mystore.com` domain and `secure` subdomain:

```diff filename="/faststore.config.js" copy
...

// Default channel
channel: '1',

+  // Production URLs
+  storeUrl: 'https://www.mystore.com',
+  secureSubdomain: 'https://secure.mystore.com',
+  checkoutUrl: 'https://secure.mystore.com/checkout',
+  loginUrl: 'https://secure.mystore.com/api/io/login',
+  accountUrl: 'https://secure.mystore.com/api/io/account',

// Lighthouse CI
lighthouse: {
...
```
4. Save your changes.
5. Open the `vtex.env` file.
6. Add the `SITE_HOST` key with the main domain specified in [Configuring domains in VTEX Account Settings](/docs/go-live/2-configuring-external-dns#step-2---configuring-domains-in-vtex-account-management) as the value.

```diff filename="/vtex.env" copy
+ SITE_HOST=www.mystore.com
```

7. Save your changes.
8. Open a Pull Request, commit your changes, and deploy them to `main`/`master`.

### Step 4 - Configuring the CDN workflow (Only for new go-lives)

If your FastStore website is going live for the first time, [open a ticket with VTEX Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) and specify that you need to configure the CDN workflow for the secure and main domains of your store. Remember to include the following information in your ticket:

- The account **name**.
- The **secure** and **main** domains of your store.

The VTEX team will evaluate your request and take the necessary actions to configure the CDN workflow for your account.
