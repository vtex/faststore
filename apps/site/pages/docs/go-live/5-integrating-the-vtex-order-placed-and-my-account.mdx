# Part 5: Integrating the VTEX Order Placed and My Account

</header>

To create a complete digital commerce experience for your FastStore project, you need to provide shoppers with a Checkout and My Account space, for example. In this guide, we'll teach you how to implement the **Order Placed** page, which displays a successful message right after the checkout process is completed, and a **My Account** space, which allows customers to manage their orders and personal data (e.g., profile info, password, addresses, and credit cards) on a single page.

Notice that, since we're using a subdomain for these integrations that is unrelated to FastStore itself, we'll use [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) in this guide. VTEX IO is a VTEX solution to create VTEX apps, but don't worry: to complete this guide, you won't need to dive into VTEX IO concepts.

## Before you start

Before proceeding any further, make sure you already have:

- Integrated your FastStore project with the VTEX Checkout. See [this guide](/how-to-guides/platform-integration/vtex/integrating-vtex-checkout) for more information.
- The VTEX IO CLI installed on your machine. Please refer to [this documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference) for more information.
- Check the Editon Store on your VTEX account:
  - **Stores using Store Framework or FastStore technology:** the `vtex.edition-store 5.x` version should be installed on your VTEX account.
  - **Stores using Legacy CMS Portal technology:** the `vtex.edition-store 3.x` version should be installed on your VTEX account.


<Callout type="info" emoji=" ℹ️ ">
Run `vtex edition get` to check if the `vtex.edition-store` app is installed on your account. If not, [open a support ticket](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) communicating you need the `vtex.edition-store@5.x` to be installed on your account so you can integrate your FastStore project with the VTEX platform.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Creating your app

1. Open the terminal and clone the [`faststore-vtex-integrations`](https://github.com/vtex/faststore-vtex-integrations/) project into your local files.

```bash copy
npx degit vtex/faststore-vtex-integrations
```

2. Open the `faststore-vtex-integrations` directory in any code editor of your preference.
3. Open the `manifest.json` file and update the value of the `vendor` field with the name of your VTEX account.
4. Using the terminal, log in to your VTEX account.

```bash copy
vtex login {account}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Replace the value between curly brackets with the name of your account.
</Callout>

5. Create a new development workspace.

```bash copy
vtex workspace use {workspace}
```
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Replace the value between curly brackets with any name of your preference, making sure the name you choose is not already taken.
</Callout>

   *Enter `Y` to continue creating the new workspace.*

6. Link your app to sync your local changes with the VTEX IO cloud development environment.

```bash copy
vtex link
```

7. Now, open a new browser window and access `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com` to see your changes live. _Remember to replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario._
8. Add items to your shopping cart and proceed to checkout. Place an order and observe if you are being taken to the Order Placed page:

![Order Placed page](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/order-placed-page___1c8555354e041450be5fb90f7ba1f7d6.png)

### Step 2 - Updating the store logo

After accessing the Order Placed page, you probably noticed the FastStore logo. Let's update it, so the **Order Placed** and **My Account** pages are presented with your store logo.

1. Save your logo inside the `assets` folder.
2. Open the `store/blocks/header.jsonc` file and update the `title`, `href`, `url`, and `width` values of your store logo (`logo#desktop` and `logo#mobile`) according to your scenario:

```jsonc filename="store/blocks/header.json" {4-7,13-16} copy
...
"logo#desktop": {
  "props": {
    "title": "{altText}",
    "href": "https://{maindomain}",
    "url": "assets/{logoPath}",
    "width": "{widthValue}"
  }
}
...
  "logo#mobile": {
  "props": {
    "title": "{altText}",
    "href": "https://{maindomain}",
    "url": "assets/{logoPath}",
    "width": "{widthValue}"
  }
}
```

3. Save your changes.

### Step 3 - (Optional) Styling the Order Placed and My Account header

If you want to change the style of the header presented in the **Order Placed** and **My Account** pages, you can update the `vtex.flex-layout.css` and `vtex.store-header.css` files contained in the `styles/css` folder. For more info, please refer to [this](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization) guide.

### Step 4 - Publishing your app

Now that everything is as expected, you need to make your changes publicly available to your store shoppers. To do that, take the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and create a production workspace.

```bash copy
vtex use {workspace} --production
```

2. Change to the `faststore-vtex-integrations` directory.
3. Release a new app version.

```bash copy
vtex release major stable
```

3. Publish your app as a candidate version.

```bash copy
vtex publish
```

4. Install the candidate version indicating the app's version as in the following:

```bash copy
vtex install {vendor}.{name}@{version}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Replace the values between curly brackets according to the `manifest.json` file of your `faststore-vtex-integrations` app.
</Callout>

5. Deploy the candidate version as a stable version.

```bash copy
vtex deploy {vendor}.{appname}@{appversion}
```

6. Promote your Production workspace to master to make your changes publicly available to your store shoppers.

```bash copy
vtex workspace promote
```

That's all. Now, if you place an order in your store, you'll be presented with the **Order Placed** page. Similarly, you'll also have access to the **My Account** page.
