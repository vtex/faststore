## Overview

TO-DO: Review this part!

Region is a feature of [VTEX Intelligent Search](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/3qgT47zY08biLP3d5os3DG) that allows for the optimization of search results according to the availability of sellers in the customer's region.

Region uses a behavior from VTEX Intelligent Search called [Availability](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/7LMQbWK5nElIkXo0NK8Kux). It searches for products available in the inventory of sellers that serve a particular region.

Stores that have more than one registered white label seller usually have specific inventories for each region. This is the case for supermarkets, for example.

With the Region feature enabled, if a customer enters their Postal Code while browsing the store (before checkout), only products available in the corresponding region will be displayed in the search results.
