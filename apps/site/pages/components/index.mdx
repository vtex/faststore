# FastStore UI

</header>

FastStore UI is an ecommerce-focused library of [brandless](/docs/theming-overview#brandless-and-theming-structure) components you can easily use on your application.
It provides features & basic style that makes it faster to implement and customize on top of it.

FastStore UI is designed and built following the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) pattern. 
Atomic Design breaks user interfaces hierarchically into smaller and simpler components and the FastStore components are classified in: **atoms, molecules, organisms** and **features**.
