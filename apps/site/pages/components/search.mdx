## Overview

This Search feature is based on Autocomplete. Autocomplete is the functionality that displays previous search results based on current and previous searches. These results are presented in four different lists, which can be together or separated, depending on the customer's interaction. The existing sections are:

- Last searches performed;
- Search suggestion;
- Product suggestion;
- Most searched terms.
