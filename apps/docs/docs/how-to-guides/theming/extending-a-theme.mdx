# Extending or modifying a theme

Themes are CSS stylesheets consisting of configurable design tokens. If you wish, you can [create your own theme from scratch](/how-to-guides/theming/creating-a-theme) or modify an existing one. In the following step-by-step, you'll learn how to customize an existing theme according to your preferences.

## Step by step

1. Open the `src/pages/_app.tsx` file and import the desired theme's stylesheet. For example:

   ```jsx
   import '../styles/themes/midnight.scss'
   ```

2. Go to `store.config.js` and change the `theme` value to the name of the desired theme (e.g., `midnight`):

   ```js
   // Theming
   theme: 'midnight',
   ```

3. Go to `src/styles/themes` and open the `scss` file of the theme being modified (e.g., `midnight.scss`). 
4. Add new tokens or change the existing ones according to your preferences. Check out the [Global Tokens](/how-to-guides/theming/global-tokens) section for more information on each token.
   
   :::caution
   Changing the value of a global token may affect different parts of your store's interface.

6. Save your changes.
