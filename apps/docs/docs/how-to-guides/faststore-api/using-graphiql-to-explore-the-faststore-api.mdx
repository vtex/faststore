# Using GraphiQL to explore the FastStore API

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). You can run GraphiQL on your browser in order to try out queries and mutations in a GraphQL API.

You can explore your store's GraphQL data layer by running a local server of your project.

## Get started

Follow these steps to run a local server and access GraphiQL:
1. Run the command `yarn develop`.
2. Once the local server is up and running, access this address on your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/__graphql
```

:::caution
If this steps do not work for you, you may not have the latest version of the `@faststore/api` dependency installed. You can reinstall it by running the command `yarn` in your project.
