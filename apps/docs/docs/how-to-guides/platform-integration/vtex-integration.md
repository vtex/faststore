# VTEX Integration

**FastStore** is a solution to develop high-performance frontends for ecommerce websites. There are, however, other pieces that compose a complete digital commerce experience. At **VTEX**, some of these core features are:

- **Checkout** - receives the shopper's information necessary to process an order.
- **OrderPlaced** - displays a successful message right after the checkout process is completed.
- **Login** - handles user login in a store.
- **MyAccount** - allows customers to manage their orders and personal data (e.g., profile info, password, addresses, and credit cards) on a single page. 

Therefore, to provide shoppers with a full checkout and post-purchase experience, you, as a developer, must guarantee the integration between your FastStore project and VTEX solutions. In the following, we provide you with a go-live checklist which you can use to keep track of the whole integration process.
