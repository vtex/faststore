# Debugging Releases and VTEX Headless CMS publishing errors

When releasing or publishing a page via the **VTEX Headless CMS** or the [**Releases** module](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/releases-module-beta--n2tN0WX5I6MJMbrJrS0Kb), you may experience long build times. 

This guide is intended to help you identify the root cause of publishing errors with the VTEX Headless CMS and Releases module.

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Verifying the Release status

1. Access the **VTEX Admin** and go to the **Releases** module (`https://{account}.myvtex.com/admin/releases`).
2. Check if your Release status corresponds to **Publishing**. If yes, open the Release and copy the hexadecimal identifier (e.g., `635feddd372d5fef67c4160e`) presented at the end of the page URL (e.g., `/admin/releases/635feddd372d5fef67c4160e`). If not, [open a support ticket describing your issue.](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk)

### Step 2 - Checking the WebOps pipeline

After getting the Release identifier, take the following steps to verify the status of its corresponding build.

1. Access the GitHub repository of your **FastStore** project (`https://github.com/vtex-sites/{account}.store`) and search for the code obtained in the previous step. If you find a commit with the corresponding Release identifier in its name, that means the Release has undergone the WebOps CI/CD.
   ![Search](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/search-commit___d0d057d83fe4bc0d22c671edbc1e67d0.png)

2. Check the status of the **Build check** for that commit by clicking on one of the following marks:

   - <span className="text-lg text-green-500">✓</span> <strong>Check mark</strong> - the build was successful. If this status does not agree with what you see in the Admin, the communication between the Releases module and WebOps must have failed. You should not worry in this case as this error is related to a communication issue on our end.
   - <span className="text-lg text-yellow-500">●</span> <strong>Circle mark</strong> - the build is queued and waiting for other builds to complete. If queued for longer than 45 minutes, please <a hred="https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk">open a support ticket.</a>
   - <span className="text-4xl text-red-500">⨯</span> <strong>Cross mark</strong> - the build failed. For more information, proceed to the following step.

### Step 3 - Identifying the build error

If the Release's build failed, take the following steps to identify the root cause of the error:

1. Click the **Details** link next to the **Build** check to see the full log.

2. Click the **Re-run checks** button to try deploying your Release again. 
   :::caution
   If you can't see the **Re-run checks** button, you might not have *write access* to the repository. In this case, please refer to your peers.
   :::

3. If the error persists, go through the build log and check the error presented.

If faced with the **Deploying development preview** and **Development deploy preview failed** errors, a technical issue on our end prevented WebOps from deploying your code. [Open a support ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk) describing the issue.

If faced with one of the following errors, either the build failed to execute, or there's a problem with the store's code. In this case, refer to our [Troubleshooting guides](/how-to-guides/troubleshooting).
