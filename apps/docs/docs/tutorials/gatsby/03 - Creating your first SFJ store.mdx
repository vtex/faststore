*Now that your development environment is set up, you are ready to create your very first FastStore storefront. Time to get busy! Let's go?*

***

In this part of the Tutorial, you will:

- Clone our [**gatsby store**](https://github.com/vtex-sites/gatsby.store) to your local machine.

  > ðŸ”Ž The **gatsby store** is a boilerplate store theme with *no styling* containing only the most basic functionalities required to run a VTEX store.

- Connect the **gatsby store** to your VTEX account in the `vtex.env` file.
- Run a local development server at `http://localhost:8000/`.
- Make the first change in your store frontend.

## Step 1: Cloning the gatsby store

1. Clone the gatsby store to your local machine by running the following command. Notice that your project name must end with `.store`.

  ```shell
  npx degit vtex-sites/gatsby.store {accountName}.store
  ```

:::info
We strongly recommend using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to download only the latest commit from the *gatsby store*. If the prompt displays **"Need to install the following packages: degit. Ok to proceed? (y)"**, enter **"y"**.

2. Change into the working directory and install all the dependencies listed within the `package.json` file  in the local `node_modules` folder.

  ```shell
  cd mystore.store
  yarn install
  ```

  :::info
  When you first install your FastStore + Gatsby store's dependencies, [*yarn*](https://yarnpkg.com/) automatically generates the `yarn.lock` file to store the exact version of each dependency needed for your project and the `node_modules` folder to save all the modules installed. Notice that, since the `yarn.lock` file already records the exact versions installed concisely, you do not need to commit the `node_modules` folder into your version-controlled repository.
  :::

## Step 2: Connecting to your VTEX account

Now that our boilerplate project is set, it's time to make it your own by connecting it to your VTEX account.

1. Open up your FastStore project in any code editor of your choice.

2. Open the `store.config.js` file and insert your environment information in these fields in `module.exports`:

  `platform` - Ecommerce platform provider of your choice.
  `api.storeId` - The name of your store or account.
  `api.environment` - Environment you wish to use.

  For instance, to connect to the VTEX platform on the store `fashioneurope`:

  ```
  module.exports = {
    platform: 'vtex',

    api: {
      storeId: 'fashioneurope'
      environment: 'vtexcommercestable'
    }
  }
  ```


## Step 3: Running a local server

Let's check how our project looks like in a web browser so far.

1. Run a local development server to serve your website.

  ```shell
  yarn develop
  ```

  This may take a few moments. Once your development server is ready, the command line will output the following message:

  ```shell
  You can now view gatsby.store in the browser.
  â €
    http://localhost:8000/
  â €
  View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema
  â €
    http://localhost:8000/___graphql
  ```

  However, this message may be quickly replaced by warnings, depending on some projectâ€™s characteristics. In this case, consider that your development server is also ready if you see this message in your command line:

  ```shell
  success Writing page-data.json files to public directory - 0.012s - 0/19 1604.51/s
  ```

  :::info
  When you start a development server for your project, yarn automatically generates the `.cache` folder and fills it with cached files to speed up the building process. Hence, you don't need to modify nor commit this folder into your version-controlled repository.
  :::

2. Now, open your favorite web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

*Congratulations!* You have just created your very first FastStore + Gatsby store website! ðŸŽ‰

Now, as long as your local development server is running, you'll be able to preview your changes while you edit your files. Saved changes will hot reload in the browser. To stop running the development server, go back to the terminal and hit `Ctrl + C`. To restart it, run `yarn develop` again.

## Step 4: Making the first change in your store frontend

Now that your store is up and running locally, let's make a simple change in the store frontend

First, let's add a simple `h1` tag to our home page.

1. Open the index.tsx file located in `src/pages`. This is the home page of your store website.
2. Look for the `Hero` component and edit its title like in the example:

```diff
-      <Hero title="See our new products" .../>
+      <Hero title="HELLO WORLD" .../>
```
3. Save your changes.

Now, let's add some CSS customization and see what happens.

4. Open the typography.css file located in `src/styles/global`.

5. Make the following changes to the file.

```diff
+ @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap');

body {
  font-size: var(--fs-text-size-base);
+  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  letter-spacing: .01em;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
```

6. Save your changes and check your browser to see the changes you have made. You may need to refresh the page.
