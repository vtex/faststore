# Troubleshooting - VTEX Headless CMS integration

Throughout this tutorial, you may come across common errors that have already tricked other FastStore users. This article is intended to help you troubleshoot some of these issues.

## Error installing the Headless CMS plugin of VTEX IO CLI

If you are a Windows user, you may find the following error after requesting to install the VTEX Headless CMS plugin of VTEX IO CLI:

```
vtex plugins install cms
warning "@vtex/cli-plugin-cms > @vtex/api > apollo-server-core > apollo-graphql@0.9.5" has incorrect peer dependency "graphql@^14.2.1 || ^15.0.0".
Installing plugin @vtex/cli-plugin-cms... failed
    Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink

    'C:\Users\LukeSkywalker\AppData\Local\vtex\node_modules\vtex'
