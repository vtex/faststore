# Part 4: Querying the CMS data

## Introduction

After syncing your Section and Content Type definitions with the VTEX Headless CMS, each Content Type will have a corresponding type on the Gatsby GraphQL layer.

In this section, we'll see how to query for this data using the Graph*i*QL IDE and how to adapt our `pages` components to consume this data.

---

## Step by step

### Step 1 - Installing the `gatsby-source-cms` plugin

To fetch data from the VTEX Headless CMS data layer into your FastStore project, you'll need to install the `@vtex/gatsby-source-cms` plugin.

1. Open the terminal and change to the source directory of your FastStore project.
2. Install the VTEX Headless CMS plugin.

```sh
yarn add @vtex/gatsby-source-cms
```

3. Open the `gatsby-config.js` file and add the following configurations for the `@vtex/gatsby-source-cms` plugin.

```diff {5-11} title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  ...,
  plugins: [
    ...,
+    {
+      resolve: '@vtex/gatsby-source-cms',
+      options: {
+        workspace: '{workspace}', //replace with the VTEX IO workspace in use - generally, use master.
+        tenant: '{account}',      //replace with the name of your VTEX account
+      },
+    },
  ],
}
```

Remember to replace the values between curly brackets according to your scenario.

### Step 2 - Querying the CMS data in GraphiQL

Before we query the CMS data in our `pages` components, let's verify how our data is structured using the GraphiQL IDE.

1. Open the terminal and change to the working directory of your project.
2. Start a development server.
   ```sh
   yarn develop
   ```
3. Open the GraphiQL IDE at [http://localhost:8000/\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/__graphql). Notice that a corresponding type on the GraphQL data layer is available for each content type that you have defined (e.g., `cmsHome`, `cmsInstitutionalPage`).
4. Test some queries and check what they return. For example, for the `home` content type, try the following query:
   ```gql
   query MyQuery {
     cmsHome {
       sections {
         name
         data
       }
     }
   }
   ```

````

This will return a JSON object as in the following example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "cmsHome": {
      "sections": [
        {
          "name": "DynamicShelf",
          "props": {
            "searchParams": {
              "hideUnavailableItems": true,
              "from": 0,
              "to": 11,
              "collection": "143"
            },
            "title": "Special Offers"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "enableRefresh": "true"
  }
}
````

Next, we'll query this data inside our React components and use it to update their contents.

### Step 3 - Querying the CMS data in the `pages` components

Let's now query the CMS data in our `pages` so we can update our React components with the CMS content.

1. Open your project in the code editor of your preference.
2. Open the corresponding `pages` component of a Content Type you're integrating with the VTEX Headless CMS. For example, for the Home Page, open `/src/pages/index.tsx`.
3. Update the GraphQL query of your content type to fetch the desired data from the CMS. Take the following example.

```graphql {10-15} title=src/pages/index.tsx
export const query = graphql`
  query HomePageQuery(
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
        description
        titleTemplate
      }
    }
    cmsHome {
      sections {
        name
        data
      }
    }
    ...
`
```

### Step 4 - Rendering the CMS content

Finally, let's update our components to present the content submitted via the VTEX Headless CMS app. To do that, take the following steps:

1. Open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Go to the `src/components` folder and create a new file named `RenderCMS.tsx`.
3. Copy and paste the following code into the `RenderCMS.tsx` file.

```tsx title="src/components/RenderCMS.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import Shelf from 'src/components/sections/Shelf'
import type { ComponentType } from 'react'

/**
 * Sections: Components imported from '../components/sections' only.
 * Do not import or render components from any other folder in here.
 */
const COMPONENTS: Record<string, ComponentType<any>> = {
  Shelf,
}

interface Props {
  sections?: Array<{ name: string; data: unknown }>
}

function RenderCMS({ sections }: Props) {
  return (
    <>
      {sections?.map(({ name, data }, index) => {
        const Component = COMPONENTS[name]

        if (!Component) {
          throw new Error(
            `Could not find component for block ${name}. Add a new component for this block or remove it from the CMS`
          )
        }

        return <Component key={`cms-section-${index}`} {...data} />
      })}
    </>
  )
}

export default RenderCMS
```

4. Import the React components corresponding to the Sections you previously created in the CMS (e.g., `RichText`, `Shelf`) and add it to `COMPONENTS`. For example:

```tsx {3,8} title="src/components/RenderCMS.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import Shelf from 'src/components/sections/Shelf'
import RichText from 'src/components/sections/RichText'
import type { ComponentType } from 'react'

const COMPONENTS: Record<string, ComponentType<any>> = {
  Shelf,
  RichText,
}
```

5. Save your changes.
6. Now, go to the `pages` component corresponding to the Content Type you are integrating with the CMS. For example, for the **Home Page**, go to the `src/pages/index.tsx` file.
7. Import the `RenderCMS` component.

```tsx
import RenderCMS from 'src/components/RenderCMS'
```

8. Add the `RenderCMS` component to your page as in the following example.

```tsx title="src/pages/index.tsx"
<RenderCMS sections={cmsHome?.sections} />
```

9. Save your changes.
