# Glossary

## B

### Base Store

An official FastStore [starter](#starter) that adheres to web performance and accessibility best practices, also serving as a guideline for all developers building storefronts with FastStore. Base Store comes with pre-configured files and plugins, and is available both for [Gatsby](#base-store-gatsby) and [Next.js](#base-store-next-js)

### Build time

The process of using a server process to compile the application files that will be delivered to a web browser later. During the build, [Static Site Generators](#static-site-generator-ssg), such as [Gatsby](#gatsby) and [Next.js](#nextjs), transform the application's code into files ready to be deployed to servers/[CDN](#content-delivery-network-cdn), and consumed by users.

## C

### Client-side rendering (CSR)

A technique used in web development that renders page content directly in the browser using JavaScript. Instead of getting all the content from HTML files, a minimal HTML file with JavaScript code is received during the initial load. This script, then, renders the rest of the web page via the browser.

### Core Web Vitals

The subset of [Web Vitals](#web-vitals) that apply to all web pages. Core Web Vitals are made up of three page speed and user interaction metrics: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A geographically distributed group of servers and data centers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

### Content Management System (CMS)

A graphical interface tool that helps editors create, edit, and publish web content without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

### Content type

The nature of a page created via the VTEX Headless CMS. A Landing Page, a Product Listing Page (PLP), and a Product Detail Page (PDP) are a few examples of different Content Types.

### Cypress

A JavaScript-based framework for [end-to-end testing](#end-to-end-e2e-testing).

## E

### End-to-end (E2E) testing 

An approach that assesses the operation of a complex product from beginning to end by verifying that every element of a system can function and perform at its best in real-world situations.

## G

### Gatsby

A [Static Site Generator](#static-site-generator-ssg) that combines functionalities from React, GraphQL, and Webpack into a single tool for building all sorts of websites and web applications.

### GraphQL

A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with the existing data.

## H

### (VTEX) Headless CMS

VTEX Headless CMS is a no-code management system for creating, editing and publishing web pages. It delivers content data to headless applications through an intermediary data layer decoupled from the frontend.

## J

### Jamstack

A web architecture that uses client-side JavaScript, APIs, and markup to build websites and apps focused on performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and developer experience. Jamstack projects normally involve a [Static Site Generator](#static-site-generator-ssg), a [Content Management System](#content-management-system-cms), and a deployment platform (e.g., Netlify, VTEX IO WebOps, Vercel).

## L

### Lighthouse

An open-source, automated tool created by Google that identifies problems and provides metrics and insights related to web page quality.

## N

### Next.js

A [Static Site Generator](#static-site-generator-ssg) created by Vercel for developing React-based web applications server-side rendering and generating static websites. 

## R

### Releases

A VTEX solution that allows retailers to coordinate planning, creating, scheduling, and publishing a bulk of interconnected changes. The Releases module is currently in Beta version. During this phase, the changes that can be grouped together must be related to the CMS. Other modules of the VTEX platform are not yet included. 

## S

### Sections

React components that occupy a whole section of a web page, such as carousel and hero components, and that are usually desirable to be integrated with a CMS.

### Server-side rendering (SSR)

A technique used in web development that converts HTML files on the server into fully rendered HTML pages for the browser at request time, rather than at [build time](#build-time).

### Static Site Generator (SSG)

A tool that interprets and transforms raw data and templates into a directory with plain HTML pages and static assets. In other words, an SSG automates the task of coding individual HTML pages and prepares those pages in advance for serving to users.

### Starter

A pre-configured FastStore project for ecommerce that can be used as a starting point. Visit our [Starter Library](/starters) page to browse official and community starters.

## W

### (VTEX IO) WebOps

VTEX IO Webops is a managed CI/CD Platform for building, testing, deploying, and serving FastStore websites. Once connected to a Git repository, WebOps builds the project and runs quality checks on every Pull Request.

### Web Vitals

A set of user-focused metrics standardized by Google that intends to measure how users experience a web page.
