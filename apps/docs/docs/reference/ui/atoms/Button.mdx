# Button

Buttons indicate actions that users can take, such as adding an item to the cart, submitting a form, and proceeding with an operation.

## Import

```tsx
import { Button } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
<Button>Hello</Button>
```

### Use cases
- An *add to cart* type of button.
- A *see more* type of button.
- An *subscription* type of button.

```tsx live
<Card>
    <img
      alt="A vintage camera"
      src="https://storecomponents.vtex.app/assets/fit-in/480x480/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstorecomponents.vtexassets.com%2Farquivos%2Fids%2F155481%2FFrame-3.jpg%3Fv%3D636793814536230000"
    />
    <div>
    <Button class="bg-green-500">ADD TO CART</Button>

</Card>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="Button" />

## Customization

`data-store-button`

## Best practices

### Do's

### Don'ts
- Don't place buttons next to badges. Although badges and buttons are similar in appearance, buttons interactive and may confuse users if not used in the proper context.

## Accessibility
- Use `<button>` or `<input>` tags with `type="button"` to identify the element as a button.
