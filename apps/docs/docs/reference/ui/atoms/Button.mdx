# Button

Buttons indicate actions that users can take, such as adding an item to the cart, submitting a form, and proceeding with an operation.

## Import

```tsx
import { Button } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
<Button>Hello</Button>
```

### Use cases

Use the `Button` component to communicate user actions on the following components:

- Buy-now and add-to-cart buttons on [Product Cards](/reference/ui/molecules/ProductCard)
- Call-to-action buttons on [Cards](/reference/ui/organisms/Card)
- Submit and/or withdraw actions on [Forms](/reference/ui/molecules/Form)
- Submit and/or withdraw actions on [Modal](/reference/ui/molecules/Modal) windows.

```tsx live
<Card>
  <img
    alt="A vintage camera"
    src="https://storecomponents.vtex.app/assets/fit-in/480x480/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstorecomponents.vtexassets.com%2Farquivos%2Fids%2F155481%2FFrame-3.jpg%3Fv%3D636793814536230000"
  />
  <div>
    <Button class="bg-green-500">ADD TO CART</Button>
  </div>
</Card>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="Button" />

## Customization

`data-fs-button`

## Best practices

### ✅ Do's

- Use standard button designs and shapes to make your button **look clickable**.
- Use styles to **communicate the importance of an action** by visually differentiating Primary and Secondary buttons.
- Make buttons **finger-friendly** for mobile users and large enough for **reliable interactions**. Generally, touch targets are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels.
- Use **task-specific** words to write button labels.
- Place the buttons in an **order that reflects a conversation between the user and the system**.
- Provide visual or audio **feedback on interactions**. Whenever a user interacts with a button, the button should change its state and let the user know that something is happening as a consequence.
- Define a style system for your **button states** (i.e., normal, focus, hover, active, pressed, disabled).
- Use icon-only buttons only for widespread actions with highly standardized icons, such as a cross for close.
- Use the `aria-label` attribute to provide a textual alternative for icon-only buttons.

### ❌ Don'ts

- Don’t make users hunt for buttons. Place buttons where users expect to see them or can easily find them.
- Don't rely on icons to communicate complex actions.
- Don't use generic words that can potentially confuse users.
- Avoid cluttering the UI with too many buttons.
- Avoid having more than one Primary action button on the screen at a time.
- Avoid using disabled buttons, if possible. Instead, give preference to hiding the unavailable option.
- Don't place buttons next to [Badges](/reference/ui/atoms/Badge). Although badges and buttons are similar in appearance, badges are not interactive and may confuse users if not used in the proper context.
- Don't use Buttons as [Links](/reference/ui/atoms/Link). Links are not intended to invite users to take action. Instead, they redirect users somewhere.
