Badges are status descriptors used to emphasize an item's state.

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

```tsx live
 <Badge>-25%</Badge>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="css" label="CSS">

```css
[data-fs-badge] {
  background-color: #be185d;
  color: #fff;
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.4rem;
  border-radius: 0.2rem;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use cases

Use the Badge component to highlight:

- Promotional discounts.
- Product features (e.g., `vegan` or `cruelty-free`).
- Product availability statuses (e.g., `NEW`,`ONLY 1 LEFT` and `OUT OF STOCK`).

```tsx live
<Card>
    <img
      alt="A vintage camera"
      src="https://storecomponents.vtex.app/assets/fit-in/480x480/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstorecomponents.vtexassets.com%2Farquivos%2Fids%2F155481%2FFrame-3.jpg%3Fv%3D636793814536230000"
    />
    <div>
    <Badge class="bg-green-500">
                back in stock
    </Badge>

    </div>
</Card>
```

## Props

## Best practices

### ✅ Do's

- Place the badge next to or on top of its related item.
- Be cautious about the badge's positioning, writing, shape, and color to avoid any confusion with components similar in appearance.

### ❌ Don'ts

- Don't use long texts in badges. A reasonable character limit is 15.
- Don't label badges with active verbs.
- Don't use color alone to convey information. If color is needed to convey meaning, ensure there is a text alternative for that meaning as well.
- Don't place badges next to buttons. Although badges and buttons are similar in appearance, badges are not interactive and may confuse users if not used in the proper context.

## Accessibility
- `id` attribute value must be unique.
- Text elements must have sufficient color contrast against the background.
