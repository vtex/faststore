import PropsSection from "@site/src/components/PropsSection/PropsSection";

`OutOfStock` displays a subscription form for shoppers who want to be alerted when a sold-out product is back in stock.

The `OutOfStock` component is a compound of the following:

- `OutOfStock`: wraps the title and content of the OutOfStock component.
- `OutOfStockTitle`: wraps the title of the OutOfStock component.
- `OutOfStockMessage`: wraps the content of the OutOfStock component.

## Import

```tsx
import { OutOfStock, OutOfStockTitle, OutOfStockMessage } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
<OutOfStock>
    <OutOfStockTitle>
        Out of Stock
    </OutOfStockTitle>
    <OutOfStockMessage>
        <span className="far fa-bell"></span> Notify me when available
        <Input type="email" placeholder="Email"/>
        <Button>Notify me</Button>
    </OutOfStockMessage>    
</OutOfStock>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="OutOfStock" />

## Customization
`data-store-out-of-stock`

`data-out-of-stock-form`

`data-out-of-stock-title`

`data-out-of-stock-message`

## Best practices

### Do's
- Use the `OutOfStock` component in PDPs.
- Specify the input type in your form to validate data (e.g., ` <Input type="email" placeholder="Email"/>`).
- Handle the form submission by informing shoppers that they will be emailed when the item is back in stock.

### Don'ts
- Don't use the `OutOfStock` component for alert messages. Instead, use the [Alert component](https://www.faststore.dev/reference/ui/molecules/Alert).
- Don't use the `OutOfStock` component in products that won't return to stock.

## Accessibility
- Text elements and buttons must have sufficient color contrast against the background.
