The `Hero` component is a full-width banner presented on the above-the-fold section of a web page. It serves as the first glimpse of your brand's identity and messaging.

The `Hero` component is a compound of the following:

- `HeroImage`: wraps the Hero image.
- `HeroHeading`: wraps the Hero textual content. It may contain a title, description, and a call-to-action button.

## Import

```tsx
import { Hero, HeroImage, HeroHeading } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Best practices

### ✅ Do's

#### Content
- Draw a clear connection between the Hero image and text.
- Ensure the copy is legible on the top of the imagery.
- Keep your message clear and connected with your visuals.

#### Visual
- Use strong contrasts to make call-to-action buttons stand out.
- Follow your brand identity and guidelines. Remember that this is the first touchpoint shoppers will have with your brand.
- Make your Hero component responsive.

#### Image
- Use optimized images for your Hero image to avoid harming your website performance. Notice that if the Hero banners take too long to load, they may lose efficacy.
- Use an eye-catching image that adds value to your page. Hero images have a significant impact on your brand perception, website traffic, and sales conversion rate.

### ❌ Don'ts

- Don't exceed 2-3 lines for the Hero headline.
- Don't use more than one Hero on a web page.
- Don't use pixelated or blurry images.

## Accessibility

- Use an `h1` or `h2` heading level for the headline.
- Choose a hero image with a strong point of focus.
- Ensure high color contrast for text over images
