`OutOfStock` displays a subscription form for shoppers who want to be alerted when the product is back in stock.
The `OutOfStock` component is a compound of the following:

- `OutOfStock`: wraps the out of stock component with title and message;
- `OutOfStockTitle`: the main title component for out of stock component;
- `OutOfStockMessage`: the message component for out of stock component;

## Import

```tsx
import {
  OutOfStock,
  OutOfStockTitle,
  OutOfStockMessage,
} from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

### Default

```tsx live
    <OutOfStock>
        buttonText="Notify me"
        notificationMsg="Notify me when available"
        onSubmit={function noRefCheck(){}}
        title="Out of Stock"
    </OutOfStock>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="OutOfStock" />

## Customization
`data-store-out-of-stock`
<br>

`data-out-of-stock-form`
<br>

`data-out-of-stock-title`
<br>

`data-out-of-stock-message`

## Best practices

### Do's
- Use the component in a PDP. 
- Inform the user when their email is incorrect, e.g. *Please enter a valid email address*.


### Don'ts
- Don't use the `OutOfStock` for alert messages, instead use the `Alert` component.
- Don't use the component in products that won't sell anymore.

## Accessibility
- Text elements and buttons must have sufficient color contrast against the background.
