# Card

Cards are used for grouping information related to a single topic. They usually present some summarized content, an image, and a call-to-action button.

The `Card` component is a compound of the following:
- `CardImage` - wraps the product image.
- `CardContent` - wraps the product details.
- `CardActions` - wraps the call-to-action button of the product card.

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge, Card, CardActions, CardImage, CardContent, Price } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
<Card>
  <CardImage>
    <img
      alt="A person with hands on the pocket, carrying a round straw bag"
      src="https://storecomponents.vtex.app/assets/fit-in/1280x613/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstorecomponents.vtexassets.com%2Fassets%2Fvtex.file-manager-graphql%2Fimages%2Fedce348c-068c-4fb9-91f2-7d235d596e0f___b2822f893b14f87337d08f07f0e520ab.jpg"
    />
  </CardImage>
  <CardContent>
    <h3>Get to know our next release</h3>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Evehicula in
      turpis sit ametl.
    </p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardActions>
    <a href="/">
      Check new releases <Icon component={<RightArrow />} />
    </a>
  </CardActions>
</Card>
```

### CardActions

## Customization

`data-fs-card-content`

`data-fs-card-actions`

## Best practices

### ✅ Do's

- Use attractive images to grab shoppers' attention.
- Keep the card content short.
- Keep a consistent visual style. Otherwise, your design may look off-putting.
- Use transparent-backgrounded images.
- Use animation and visual hints to improve the user experience.
- Use the most appropriate card size for each device type.
- Make the entire card clickable to create larger touch zones.

### ❌ Don'ts

- Don't use the `Card` component for product cards. Instead, use the [`ProductCard` component](/reference/ui/molecules/ProductCard).
- Avoid cluttering cards with too many buttons and content. 
- Avoid inline links.

## Accessibility

- Text elements and buttons must have sufficient color contrast against the background.
