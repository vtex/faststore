# Card

Cards are used for grouping information related to a single topic. They usually present some summarized content, an image, and a call-to-action button.

The `Card` component is a compound of the following:
- `CardImage` - wraps the product image.
- `CardContent` - wraps the product details.
- `CardActions` - wraps the call-to-action button of the product card.

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge, Card, CardActions, CardImage, CardContent, Price } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
<Card>
  <CardImage>
    <img
      alt="A vintage camera"
      src="https://assets.vtex.app/unsafe/1080x720/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstoreframework.vtexassets.com%2Farquivos%2Fids%2F190897%2FPhoto.jpg"
    />
  </CardImage>
  <CardContent>

  </CardContent>
  <CardActions>
    <Button onClick={function noRefCheck(){}}>
      LEARN MORE
    </Button>
  </CardActions>
</Card>
```

## Props

All Card-related components support all attributes also supported by the `<div>` tag.

### Card

<PropsSection name="Card" />

### CardActions

<PropsSection name="CardActions" />

### CardContent

<PropsSection name="CardContent" />

### CardImage

<PropsSection name="CardImage" />

## Customization

`data-store-card`

`data-store-card-image`

`data-store-card-content`

`data-store-card-actions`

## Best practices

### Do's

- Use attractive images to grab shoppers' attention.
- Keep the card content short.
- Keep a standard visual style. Otherwise, your design may look off-putting.
- Use transparent-backgrounded images.
- Use animation and visual hints to improve the user experience.
- Use the most appropriate card size for each device type.
- Make the entire card clickable to create larger touch zones.

### Don'ts

- Don't use the `Card` component for product cards. Instead, use the [`ProductCard` component](/reference/ui/molecules/ProductCard).
- Avoid cluttering cards with too many buttons and content. 
- Avoid inline links.

## Accessibility

- Text elements and buttons must have sufficient color contrast against the background.
