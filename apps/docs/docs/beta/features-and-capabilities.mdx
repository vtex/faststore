## VTEX IO FastStore

**VTEX IO FastStore** is an **open-source toolkit** for headless storefront development composed of **three independent packages (UI, SDK, and API)** optimized for speed and conversion.

- Use **FastStore UI** to add accessibility-ready components to your storefront.
- Use **FastStore SDK** to manage the states related to your store behavior.
- Use **FastStore API** to connect to VTEX's native APIs and other external services (like CMSs, search engines and more).

## VTEX IO WebOps

**VTEX IO Webops** is a **managed CI/CD Platform** for building, testing, deploying, and serving FastStore websites. With Webops, key stakeholders from all business areas, from developers to commerce managers, have the autonomy to make data-driven decisions around performance and code quality together. 
Once connected to a **Git repository**, WebOps builds the project and runs **quality checks on every Pull Request** through four main steps:

- **Build** - builds the website and provides a deploy preview.
- **SonarQube** - measures and analyzes code quality with static analysis, aiming to prevent bugs and bad practices from going into production.
- **Lighthouse CI** - runs Lighthouse audits, showing how the new developments impacted the website performance.
- **Integration tests** - combines individual applications and tests them as a group with Cypress to evaluate the project compliance as a whole.

**Coming soon:**
- Dashboard for monitoring deploys;
- Interface to create and manage projects;
