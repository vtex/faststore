# Customer invitation

Even though FastStore is an open-source toolkit that works with any CMS or deployment platform, you must be a member of the Closed Beta to use it along with WebOps and Headless CMS.

FastStore is an open-source toolkit that works with any CMS or deployment platform. In this regard, you are free to explore the toolkit with different clients. However, in this scenario, the agency or client assumes full responsibility for these implementations. 
Therefore, keep in mind that, to receive support from VTEX, you must enroll in the Closed Beta. Once you do, you will be able to use FastStore alongside other VTEX products like WebOps and Headless CMS.

## Who is eligible?

Fatores para levar em consideraÃ§Ã£o:
- **Business model.** We prioritize diversity of industries, regions, and business models. This is one of the reasons we keep the program in closed beta: we want to ensure that the product is ready to meet the key needs of VTEX customers across different industries, sizes, regions, and models.
- **Project deadlines.** New clients migrating to VTEX often have shorter deadlines. Hence, the approval time for the FastStore Closed Beta and the degree of experimentation with this new technology may not meet the client's needs.

## How to suggest clients to the closed beta?

> We advise avoiding extending invitations to new clients for FastStore during the Closed Beta. During this phase, the amount of clients we can serve is restricted since we offer closer support from our product team.
