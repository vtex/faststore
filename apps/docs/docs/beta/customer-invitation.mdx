# Customer invitation

FastStore is an open-source toolkit that works with any CMS or deployment platform. In this regard, everyone is free to explore the toolkit with different Jamstack solutions. In these cases, however, **VTEX does not assume any responsibility for the project implementation**.

Therefore, the client must be part of the Closed Beta to use FastStore along with WebOps and Headless CMS and benefit from VTEX's support.

**Currently, however, we recommend not offering the technology to new clients** as support from the product team is closer and therefore limited to a maximum number of customers, which has already been reached.
