# Beta Program Overview

Welcome to the VTEX IO FastStore, WebOps, and VTEX Headless CMS Beta Program, a program that gives you everything you need to build, ship, and evolve headless shopping experiences, blazing-fast by design.

The program is still only accessible to [**selected customers**](/beta/customer-invitation), yet you can start exploring the new technologies before we move to Open Beta. [Click here](/docs) to get started.

## Timeline, scope, and developer actions

The **FastStore, WebOps, and Headless CMS Beta Program** has been running since January of 2022, and it's expected to continue throughout 2022 and the first half of 2023. 

> Divided into **three key milestones**, the first stage is formed by an MVP-quality release of **the three technologies** for selected customers, as well as the initiation of a developer preview where partners and technical teams can [**explore the new technologies**](/beta/features-and-capabilities) and [**give feedback**](/beta/feedback-and-issue-tracking). 

During the Closed Beta stage, the VTEX team will be gradually inviting more customers to test it. [Click here](/beta/customer-invitation) to know how to add a customer to the **waiting list**.

The program is expected to move to an **Open Beta availability in 2023**, as the focus shifts toward platform stability and accelerated onboarding and setup. During the Open Beta, any customer interested in joining the program will be accepted â€” as well as any SI or developers looking to use it in their next project are recommended to do so. Still, feedback and issues reporting will remain available as we act on gaps prior to the General Availability release.

Release dates for the Open Beta and General Availability will be defined as the program evolves, and dates will be updated to this page as they become available.
