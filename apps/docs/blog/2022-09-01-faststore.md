# New and improved FastStore API guides

There are new and improved FastStore API guides available on our [documentation portal](/docs):

- [Using a GraphQL IDE to explore the FastStore API](/how-to-guides/faststore-api/explore-the-faststore-api)
- [Fetching API data on the storefront](/how-to-guides/faststore-api/fetching-api-data)
- [Extending the GraphQL schema](/how-to-guides/faststore-api/extending-the-faststore-api)

## What has changed?

Previously, the [GraphQL IDE guide](/how-to-guides/faststore-api/explore-the-faststore-api) focused on GraphiQL. However, GraphiQL is not natively supported by the [Base Store starters](/starters/base) anymore.

Now, you can still run your FastStore project locally and, although the new guide contains specific instructions for using [graphql-playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground), you may use your preferred GraphQL IDE.

In addition, now you can find more precise instructions and code examples of how to use the FastStore API in your storefront with the guides [Fetching API data on the storefront](/how-to-guides/faststore-api/fetching-api-data) and [Extending the GraphQL schema](/how-to-guides/faststore-api/extending-the-faststore-api).
