# WebOps deploys are now on GitHub environments

The automatic previews of your FastStore + WebOps project Pull Requests are now deployed with [GitHub environments](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).

## What has changed?

Previously, if you committed code to a branch with an open pull request, the `vtex-sites` bot would add a comment with the link to the PR's corresponding deploy preview. For example:
![Previous deploy in bot comment](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/1_187782153-7d9662f6-6c15-4f6f-915e-a348f88414fc___bda6116cb4b9bda978500e363646c6ce.png)

Now, this comment is no longer provided. Instead, you should check the GitHub environments section. You should see something like this in your pull request:
![New deploy with Github environment](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/2.2_187971849-6c66b530-a0d5-4310-b56b-a1826bf886f5___592d23128d214ac58f4c146f486a1219.png)

You can see the available environments on your repository's home page, on the right side of the screen. As of now, there are two environments: `FastStore Preview` and `FastStore Production`.

## What needs to be done?

This feature is already active for all projects. There is no action required.
