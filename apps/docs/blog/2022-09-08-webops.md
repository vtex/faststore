# Preview deploys are now on GitHub environments

The automatic previews of your FastStore project's Pull Requests are now deployed with [GitHub environments](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).

## What has changed?

Previously, if you committed code to a branch with an open pull request, you would see the corresponding previews deployed in a bot comment such as this one:
![Previous deploy in bot comment]()

Now, previews are deployed with GitHub environments, which means you should see something like this in your pull request:
![New deploy with Github environment]()

Also, this type of deployment has the advantage of working in production. You can see the available environments in your repository's home page, at the right side of the screen.

## What needs to be done?

There is no action required.
