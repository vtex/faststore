## Features üöÄ

- **New component: Accordion molecule** [(#985)](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/985)
  We have added the [Accordion component](https://faststoreui.netlify.app/?path=/docs/molecules-accordion--multiple-and-collapsible) to the FastStore UI. The Accordion component hides its content by default.

  We have added the [Breadcrumb Molecule](https://faststoreui.netlify.app/?path=/docs/molecules-breadcrumb--breadcrumb) to the FastStore UI. Use it to create secondary navigation and help users identify their location in the store.

## Breaking Changes üí•

- **Lighthouse CI updated: Changes on performance score and Lighthouse report**
  We have updated the Lighthouse CI to the [version 8 of Google Lighthouse](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/lighthouse-v8) that can reflect on score variations in Lighthouse CI of Pull Requests.

From now on, the overall score of **`Cumulative Shift Layout` and `Total Blocking Time` have increased in importance**, and the **deprioritized** metrics are **`First Contentful Paint`, `Speed Index`, and `Time to Interactive`.**
