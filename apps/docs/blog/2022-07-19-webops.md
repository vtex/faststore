# Additional WebOps variable required to launch new FastStore websites

To go live, **FastStore** projects developed with **Gatsby 4** and **Next.js** require a new environment variable. This new setting relates to improving and automating the hosting flow in WebOps.

#### What has changed?

Setting up the `SITE_HOST` environment variable is now necessary in order to deploy new FastStore websites, developed with Gatsby 4 and Next.js, to production.

#### Why did we make these changes?

To improve the hosting flow in WebOps, the WebOps team built a new automation related to this new environment variable.

#### What needs to be done?

Open the `vtex.env` file and add the `SITE_HOST` key with the main domain specified in **VTEX Account Management** as the value. For more information, please refer to [Configuring external DNS for a custom domain](/how-to-guides/platform-integration/vtex/hosting-a-faststore-vtex-website).

```diff title="vtex.env"
+ SITE_HOST= {hostDomain}
```
