# New environment flag improves deploy cache use

The `USE_FRAMEWORK_CACHE` and `USE_NODE_MODULES_CACHE` environment flags were deprecated in favor of `USE_BUILD_CACHE`. The new flag improves the build time by reusing cache from previous commits in newer deploy previews of the same Pull Request.

## What has changed?

The new `USE_BUILD_CACHE` flag replaces the previously used `USE_FRAMEWORK_CACHE` and `USE_NODE_MODULES_CACHE` flags.

To exemplify the improvement, consider the git example below.

```
master: commit-sha-1
PR 233:
       - commit-sha-2
       - commit-sha-3
```

Previously, the build correponding to `commit-sha-3` would use `commit-sha-1` cache. Now it uses the cache generated for `commit-sha-2`. In case the `commit-sha-2` does not exist, the build would use the `commit-sha-1` cache.

## What needs to be done?

To use this new improvement, set the `USE_BUILD_CACHE` flag to `true` in the `vtex.env` file of your FastStore project.
