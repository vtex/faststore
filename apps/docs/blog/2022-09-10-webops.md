# Changes in environment cache flags

WebOps is making available a new environment cache flag: `USE_BUILD_CACHE`. It replaces the previously used `USE_FRAMEWORK_CACHE` and `USE_NODE_MODULES_CACHE` flags.

## What has changed?

WebOps can now reuse pull requests' cache for new commit deploys.

## What needs to be done?

You can set this flag in the `vtex.env` file of your FastStore project.
