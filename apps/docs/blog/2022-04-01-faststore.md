# FastStore - March, 2022

The FastStore API now includes an Express GraphQL Server, and the FastStore UI now has a new `Dropdown` component. Also, the performance of the `useStorage` hook has been improved.

## FastStore UI

### Dropdown

- üéâ **New `Dropdown` molecule** - [#1178](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1178) Use the `Dropdown` component as an options menu or a dropdown select.

## FastStore SDK

### setSession function

- üêõ **Fixed `setSession` function type** - [#1172](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1172)
  Now the `ContextValue` of the `setSession` function receives a `session: Partial<Session>` argument. With the fix, it's possible to pass partial information of a session. For example:

```
const { setSession } = useSession()
setSession({ postalCode: 'foo' })
```

- ‚ú® **Improve the performance of `useStorage` hook** - [#1186](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1186)
  The `setTimeout` function was created to prevent the creation of tasks that take longer than 50ms to process. The function improves the performance of the `useStorage` hook by wrapping two of its tasks: the async promise and the set state of an item.

- ‚ú® **Add `setFacets` function to the search context** - [#1189](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1189)
  The `setFacets` function sets all selected facets without any processing, allowing full control of the selected facets.

## FastStore API

### VTEX Platform

- üêõ **Added missing `totalCount` field to `pageInfo` in `allCollections` query** - [#1173](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1173)
  Now the resolver for the `allCollections` query returns the number of valid collections in the store when a user asks for `pageInfo.totalCount` field.
- üéâ **New `Session` query** - [#1176](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1176)
  The `Session` query returns only the channel and country values. The addition of this query enables VTEX regionalization, which requires the `regionId` located within the channel.
- üéâ **Add local server and GraphQL tests** - [#1179](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1179)
  The `@faststore/api` package now comes with an [Express GraphQL Server](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/) setup allowing you to test the API without having to link the package to a store.

- ‚ú® **`hideUnavaibleitems` parameter in the search API** - [#1180](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1180)
  The Search API now has a parameter called `hideUnavailableItems`. This parameter either hides (true) or displays (false) an out-of-stock product.

- üêõ **Removed frontend computation to the backend** - [#1184](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1184)
  Offers are now sorted according to the order of the `offers` array.

- ‚ú® **Returning null as profile** - [#1190](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1190)
  Now the API returns `null` for the `person` query when executed by an anonymous user, avoiding a mismatch with the default user session values, preventing the session of the anonymous user from being reset, and lowering the Total Blocking Time (TBT) metric.

## Documentation

- üìë Added [VTEX Headless CMS API Reference](https://faststore.dev/vtex-headless-cms-api) - [#1194](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1194)
  The `vtex.admin-releases@0.x` app was added to [Step 2 - Installing the Headless CMS app on your VTEX account](https://faststore.dev/tutorials/cms/1#step-2---installing-the-headless-cms-app-on-your-vtex-account). The app is one of the VTEX Headless CMS's required apps.

## Internal

- üêõ **Fixed codebase typos** - [#1183](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/pull/1183)
