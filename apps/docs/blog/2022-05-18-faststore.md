# FastStore API documentation available on GraphiQL

FastStore API reference documentation is now available. You can check it now via the [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) IDE.

## What has changed?

While working on your FastStore website, you can run your project locally and use **GraphiQL** to explore the API. Now, when you do this you will see that each type, argument, query and mutation has an associated description.

## What needs to be done?

To explore the FastStore API reference documentation, follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn` in your project to reinstall the `@faststore/api` dependency.
2. Run `yarn develop` to start a local server.
3. Access GraphiQL by going to this address:

```
http://localhost:8000/__graphql
```

4. Click on the `Docs` button on the upper right corner.
5. On the docs tab you can browse through the definitions or search for types by name.
