# FastStore API documentation updated

We have made available FastStore API reference documentation. You can check it now by using [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

## What has changed?

When locally running a FastStore project, you can head to this address to use **GraphiQL** and explore the API:
```
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Now, when you do this you will see that each type, argument, querie and mutation has an associated description.

## What needs to be done?

In order to preview the descriptions via **GraphiQL**, you must install the latest version of the `@faststore/api` package.
