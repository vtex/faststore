# FastStore API documentation updated

We have made available FastStore API reference documentation. You can check it now by using [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).

## What has changed?

When working on a FastStore project, you can run it locally and use **GraphiQL** to explore the API. Now, when you do this you will see that each type, argument, querie and mutation has an associated description.

## What needs to be done?

To see these new docs follow these steps:
1. Run `yarn` in your project to reinstall the `@faststore/api` dependency.
2. Run `yarn develop` to start a local server.
3. Go to this address:
```
http://localhost:8000/__graphql
```
4. Click on the `Docs` button on the upper right corner.
