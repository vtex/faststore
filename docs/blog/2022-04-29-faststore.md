# New Next.js starter available

VTEX launched a new [Next.js based FasStore starter](https://github.com/vtex-sites/nextjs.store). It is actually a base store starter, identical in every way to the existing base store, which used Gatsby, except for the framework.

## What has changed?

Now, developers that wish to use Next.js for their FastStore projects, have the opportunity of getting started with this 

Also, because this is another base store starter, [the name of the repository formerly known as `basestore` was changed to `gatsby.store`](https://faststore.dev/releases/2022/04/29/basestore).


## What needs to be done?
