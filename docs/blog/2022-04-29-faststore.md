# New Next.js starter available

VTEX launched a new [Next.js based FasStore starter](https://github.com/vtex-sites/nextjs.store). It is actually a base store starter, identical in every way to the existing base store, which used Gatsby, except for the framework.

## What has changed?

Now, developers that wish to use Next.js with FastStore, can leverage our base store starter to get their projects going.

Also, because this is another base store starter, [the name of the repository formerly known as `basestore` was changed to `gatsby.store`](https://faststore.dev/releases/2022/04/29/basestore).

## What needs to be done?

To learn more and start your FastStore project with Next.js, check the [Next.js store repository](https://github.com/vtex-sites/nextjs.store).
