# New Next.js starter available

We launched a [Next.js-based starter](https://github.com/vtex-sites/nextjs.store) that corresponds to the [Base Store](/starters/base) previously available only for Gatsby. This means you can now quickstart your FastStore project with your favorite framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

## What has changed?

Now, developers that wish to use Next.js with FastStore, can leverage our base store starter to get their projects going.

Also, because the Base Store is now available for Next.js and Gatsby, [the name of the repository formerly known as `base.store` was changed to `gatsby.store`](https://faststore.dev/releases/2022/04/29/basestore).

## What needs to be done?

To learn more and start your FastStore project with Next.js, check the [Next.js store repository](https://github.com/vtex-sites/nextjs.store).
