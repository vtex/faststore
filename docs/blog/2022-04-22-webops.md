# Automated Lighthouse reports for deploy previews

Now every deploy preview will have a new *Lighthouse Reports* box with quick-access links to reports for all pages you have listed in the Lighthouse CI section of the `store.config.js` file. That way, you can easily track how each pull request impacts the performance, SEO, and accessibility of your store.

## What has changed?

The Lighthouse CI/CD now generates Lighthouse Reports via [Google Lighthouse Viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/) for each deploy preview and uploads them to AWS S3. WebOps, then, comments on new PRs with links to the reports. 

Links to these reports are also shared in the logs of the WebOps pipeline for Lighthouse.

## Why did we make these changes?

These changes aim to make it simpler for you to track how each deploy affects your website's performance.

## What needs to be done?

These changes are already available for everyone. From now on, WebOps will automatically add a comment to new PRs with links to Lighthouse reports.
