# What is Gatsby?

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)-based [static site generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction#static_site_generators) that brings together the best of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), React, GraphQL, and other modern tools to provide a better developer experience. 

## Why we chose Gatsby?

### No breaking changes

Most technologies used by Gatsby are already familiar to the developers working with VTEX IO. The same way as with Gatsby, our [Store Framework components](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/what-is-store-framework) are built with React. 

Bringing Gatsby and VTEX together means a fast learning curve to a universe that will allow you to build the fastest stores in the market.

### Easy data integration

Leveraging from the GraphQL power, Gatsby allows you to collect data from any source of your choosing: Markdown, JSON, third-party APIs, and even from the VTEX CMS.  

By creating an internal GraphQL server, Gatsby makes all that fetched data accessible via React components during build time. 

### Extensible architecture

For building more complex websites, Gatsby provides thousands of plugins on its [Plugin Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) that lets you modularize customizations into specific functionalities.

Additionally, thanks to its plugin-based ecosystem, Gatsby allows you to add new functionalities to your website, making it even more flexible and extensible.

### High customization level

With [shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/), Gatsby increases customization levels, allowing the developer to overwrite [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) files with customized ones.
