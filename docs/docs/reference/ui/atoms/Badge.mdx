Badges are status descriptors used to highlight the status of an item.

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
 <Badge>-25%</Badge>
```
### Use cases

Use the Badge component to hightlight:

- Promotional discounts.
- Product features (e.g., `vegan` or `cruelty-free`).
- Product availability status (e.g., `NEW`,`ONLY 1 LEFT` and `OUT OF STOCK`).

```tsx live
<Card>
    <img
      alt="A vintage camera"
      src="https://storecomponents.vtex.app/assets/fit-in/480x480/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstorecomponents.vtexassets.com%2Farquivos%2Fids%2F155481%2FFrame-3.jpg%3Fv%3D636793814536230000"
    />
    <div>
    <Badge class="bg-green-500">
                back in stock
    </Badge>

    </div>
</Card>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="Badge" />

## Customization

`data-store-badge`

## Best practices

### Do's

- Place the badge next to or on top of its related item.
- Be cautious about the badge's positioning, writing, shape, and color to avoid any confusion with components similar in appearance.

### Don'ts

- Don't use long texts in badges. A reasonable character limit is 15.
- Don't label badges with active verbs.
- Don't use color alone to convey information. If color is needed to convey meaning, ensure there is a text alternative for that meaning as well.
- Don't place badges next to buttons. Although badges and buttons are similar in appearance, badges are not interactive and may confuse users if not used in the proper context.

## Accessibility
- [`id` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/duplicate-id?application=axeAPI) value must be unique.
- Text elements must have [sufficient color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/color-contrast?application=axeAPI) between the text and the background.
