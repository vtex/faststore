# Badge

Badges are status descriptors used to highlight a relevant content.

## Import

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
 <Badge>-25%</Badge>
```
### Use cases

- On-sale products.
- Product features, for example `vegan` or `cruelty-free`.
- Product status, for example `new`,`only 1 left` and `back in stock`.

```tsx live
<Card>
    <img
      alt="A vintage camera"
      src="https://storecomponents.vtex.app/assets/fit-in/480x480/center/middle/https%3A%2F%2Fstorecomponents.vtexassets.com%2Farquivos%2Fids%2F155481%2FFrame-3.jpg%3Fv%3D636793814536230000"
    />
    <div>
    <Badge class="bg-green-500">
                back in stock
    </Badge>

    </div>
</Card>
```

## Props

<PropsSection name="Badge" />

## Customization

`data-store-badge`

## Best practices

### Do's
- Write clear and short text.
- Have a clear position of the badge to identify which product the badge is related.
- Use a color palette to establish the relevance and status of the product and get the users' attention

### Don'ts
- Avoid placing badges next to buttons. Although they look similar, a badge is not as interactive as a button.

## Accessibility
- [`id` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/duplicate-id?application=axeAPI) value must be unique.
- Text elements must have [sufficient color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.3/color-contrast?application=axeAPI) between the text and the background.
