Skeletons are placeholders that indicate your content data is loading. Skeletons improve the perceived responsiveness of the page and are useful to reduce load-time frustration.

## Import

```tsx
import { Skeleton } from '@faststore/ui'
```

## Usage

```tsx live
<Skeleton/>
```

## Props

<PropsComponent
    name="testId"
    type= "string"
    description="ID to find this component in testing tools (e.g.: cypress, testing library, and jest)."
    defaultValue="store-skeleton"
/>

## Customization

`data-store-skeleton`
