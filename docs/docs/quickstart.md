## Start with Gatsby

### Step 1. Starting a new FastStore project

Clone the [`base.store`](https://github.com/vtex-sites/base.store) project into your local files and change to the corresponding working directory.

```sh
npx degit vtex-sites/base.store mystore.store && cd mystore.store
```

### Step 2. Installing dependencies

Install dependencies using yarn.

```sh
yarn install
```

### Step 3. Configuring your project settings

Open the `store.config.js` file using the code editor of your choice and set up the config to you store.

1. Replace  the`storeId` value with the id of your account.
2. Replace the `storeUrl` and `checkoutUrl` values with the corresponding production URLs of your store.
3. Go to the `lighthouse.pages` property and add the paths of the pages you want to track performance over time.
4. Go to the `cypress.pages` property and add the paths of the pages you want to end-to-end test before each release.

### Step 4. Running your store locally

Start a development server on port 8000.

```sh
yarn develop
```

Your store will start at a hot-reloading environment at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), and you'll also have access to GraphiQL at [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql), a tool that you can use to fetch data and build queries. 

ðŸŽ‰ *That's all!* You're now ready to start making changes to your FastStore + Gatsby storefront.
