## What is VTEX IO WebOps

VTEX IO WebOps is one of the core capabilities delivered by [VTEX IO](faststore.md) - a *Digital Commerce Experience Platform powered by VTEX* that helps e-commerce stores accelerate their business' evolution. 

VTEX IO WebOps provides increased **deployment observability**, focused on vital **e-commerce metrics**, such as performance and SEO. It does that by delivering a developer-first workflow automation and a **fully customizable**, pre-configured Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (that allows developers to make educated decisions while evolving their digital experience.)

With the VTEX IO WebOps CI pipeline, key stakeholders from all business areas, from developers to commerce managers, get empowered to **make data-driven decisions** around performance and code quality together.

## How it works

By connecting with a Git provider (e.g., [Github](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)), the VTEX IO WebOps CI flow is apt to run E2E tests and evaluate the impact of each Pull Request on a store's performance through four main steps:

- **Build** - provides a preview of a store's appearance for the latest deployments.
- **SonarQube** - prevents bugs and bad practices from going into production by measuring and analyzing code quality with static analysis.
- **Lighthouse CI** - detects performance issues by detailing how performance changed with the new developments.
- **Integration Tests** - evaluate the project compliance by combining individual applications and testing them as a group with Cypress.

These technologies and tools provide all the necessary support for developers to create blazing fast stores with over 90 [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)[/Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals) scores. In practice, this means an increase in the store's SEO score, conversion rate, and navigation experience. VTEX IO WebOps also enables tracking history changes and helps diagnose when and why regressions happened.
