## What is Faststore 

[Faststore](https://github.com/vtex/faststore) is a light yet powerful **set of libraries** made for developers who want to explore their knowledge and creativity building comprehensive and unique ecommerce solutions. It supports integrations with headless ecommerce platforms, allows meaningful analytics capabilities, and gives developers back the freedom of customization.

## What is included

That is possible because Faststore was cleverly split into **a UI and an SDK package.** The UI package is a **CSS framework-agnostic** library that crafts the behavior of React components into data attributes. The SDK is an extensible state management library that handles all meaningful states an e-commerce store might have, such as:
- **User session** - handles auth, region, locale, and currency data.
- **Cart** - handles the addition, remotion, update, and current state of a store cart.
- **UI** - handles the state of the components of a store (e.g., display/hide mini cart).
- **Search** - handles the state of the faceted search (e.g., apply filters and sort).

Our SDKs also provide GA4 compatible analytics functions to help you create powerful analytics capabilities in your e-commerce. 

Faststore never constrains developers to any proprietary framework. It is opinionated by default but flexible under the hood.
