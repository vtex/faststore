# Troubleshooting

Throughout this tutorial, you may come across common errors that have already tricked other FastStore users. This article is intended to help you troubleshoot some of these issues.

## Part 1: Setting up your development environment

### Error: command settings not found

This error occurs because the `settings` plugin from the VTEX IO CLI is not installed. To fix this problem, please run the following command:

```
vtex plugins install settings
```

### Error: App has route conflict

This error occurs because a version of the app with route conflict is already installed in your VTEX Account. To fix this problem, please use the `--force` flag after the app specification, for example:

```shell
vtex install vtex.store-sitemap@2.x --force
```

### Error: API 403 Forbidden

This error occurs because the user trying to set up the `enableOrderFormOptimization` setting doesn't have the necessary [User Role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc?&utm_source=autocomplete) to perform this action. To fix this issue, please ask for a VTEX user with the **Owner (Admin Super)** role to run this command.
