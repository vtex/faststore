# How to contribute

## Developing Locally

### Developing Packages that depend on one another at the same time

1. Run `yarn` at the root of the repo.

2. Run `yarn lerna link --force-local` at the root of the repo.

3. Run `yarn build` at the root of the repo.

4. Run `yarn develop` at each of the packages that depends on the other.

> You can run a package individually: `yarn workspace {packageName} develop`

### Developing packages while also testing on a store

1. Repeat the steps from the above section

2. Run `yarn link` on the package that you are developing

3. Run `yarn` at the store's repo

4. If the store's repo already have the package that you are developing as a dependency, just run `yarn link {packageName}`

5. If your package is not an npm dependency yet, you can develop locally by referring to your local version of the package on gatsby config.

Example:

```ts
{
  resolve: '/Users/jmgris/work/faststore/packages/gatsby-plugin-pixel-facebook'
}
```

## Creating Pull Requests

2. A bot will commit on master releasing your changes. In the meantime, go grab a coffee â˜•

> If the bot isn't working or you want to release it manually, use the following command to clean any artifact and release a clean build:
>
> `git clean -fdx && yarn && lerna run build && lerna publish patch --yes`

3. Update `package.json` of the `storecomponents` with:
```
yarn upgrade -L --scope @vtex
```

4. Stage, commit and push your changes with:
```
git add . && git commit -m "upgrade deps" && git push
```

5. Rebase with master
