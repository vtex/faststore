# How to contribute

## Developing Locally

### Developing Packages that depend on one another at the same time

1. Run `yarn` at the root of the repo.

2. Run `yarn lerna link --force-local` at the root of the repo.

3. Run `yarn build` at the root of the repo.

4. Run `yarn dev` at each of the packages that depends on the other.

> You can run a package individually: `yarn workspace {packageName} develop`

### Developing packages while also testing on a store

1. Repeat the steps from the above section

2. Run `yarn link` on the package that you are developing

3. Run `yarn` at the store's repo

4. If the store's repo already have the package that you are developing as a dependency, just run `yarn link {packageName}`

5. If your package is not an npm dependency yet, you can develop locally by referring to your local version of the package on gatsby config.

Example:

```ts
{
  resolve: '/Users/jmgris/work/faststore/packages/gatsby-plugin-pixel-facebook'
}
```

### Creating Components on the `faststore/ui`

You can generate the boilerplate files for your new component using the following command:

- run `yarn generate-ui-component`

```bash
# What is your component name?

ComponentName

#  What is your component atomic group?  (Use arrow keys)

> atoms
> molecules
> organisms
```

- It will automatically generate the files below:

```
âœ”  ++ faststore/packages/ui/src/atoms/ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx
âœ”  ++ faststore/packages/ui/src/atoms/ComponentName/index.tsx
âœ”  ++ faststore/packages/styles/src/atoms/component-name.css
âœ”  ++ faststore/packages/ui/src/atoms/ComponentName/ComponentName.test.tsx
âœ”  ++ faststore/packages/ui/src/atoms/ComponentName/stories/ComponentName.stories.tsx
âœ”  ++ faststore/packages/ui/src/atoms/ComponentName/stories/ComponentName.mdx
âœ”  _+ faststore/packages/ui/src/index.ts
```

And that is it! You will be ready to work on your component. ðŸŽ‰

> For the component name, please follow the Pascal Case pattern, and do not use `-`, i.e., Component-Name.

> Please do not edit `// Atoms`, `// Molecules` and `// Organisms` comments on `packages/ui/scr/index.ts` [file](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/blob/b1badead35dc43b41f25480a66f4e81cc9a8e22a/packages/ui/src/index.ts), because we are using it as a [pattern](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/blob/443cbd117e34ea1702a2994ca4ad0b2733f17189/generators/plopfile.ts#L62) to update the file.

## Creating Pull Requests

1. Create a production build by running `yarn build` at the root of the package that you are developing

2. Commit your changes in a branch

3. Push your changes to the remote repo and open a Pull Request

4. Use the `Local Install Instructions` provided on the `CodeSandBox` bot in the PR to add your version of the packages as dependencies in the `package.json` file of the [storecomponents](https://github.com/vtex-sites/storecomponents.store).

5. Submit a Pull Request with this changes to `storecomponents`

6. Wait for checks to pass and reviews to be approved.

## Release

1. After acquiring the necessary approval, rebase and squash-merge your PR in master

2. A bot will commit on master releasing your changes. In the meantime, go grab a coffee â˜•

> If the bot isn't working or you want to release it manually, use the following command to clean any artifact and release a clean build:
>
> `git clean -fdx && yarn && lerna run build && lerna publish patch --yes`

3. Update `package.json` of the `storecomponents` with:

```
yarn upgrade -L --scope @vtex
```

4. Stage, commit and push your changes with:

```
git add . && git commit -m "upgrade deps" && git push
```

5. Rebase with master
